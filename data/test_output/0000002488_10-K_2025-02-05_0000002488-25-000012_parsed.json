In addition, we expect continued competition from the ASIC market, which has been ongoing since the inception of FPGAs. Intel is our main competitor for embedded CPUs. Other competitors include manufacturers of high-density programmable logic products characterized by FPGA-type architectures; high-volume and low-cost FPGAs as programmable replacements for ASICs and ASSPs; ASICs and ASSPs with incremental amounts of embedded programmable logic; high-speed, low-density CPLDs; high-performance DSP devices; products with embedded processors; products with embedded multi-gigabit transceivers; discrete general-purpose GPUs targeting data center and automotive applications; and other new or emerging programmable logic products\n.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nWe focus our research and development (R&D) activities on designing and developing products. Our main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of processors (CPU and GPU), FPGAs and Adaptive SoCs, accelerators (adaptive, graphics and DPU), SOMs and SmartNICs and associated software. We focus on designing, with security in mind, new integrated circuits (ICs) with improved performance and performance-per-watt in advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes, the design of logic and interface IP, advanced packaging technologies, and heterogeneous integration technologies. We also focus on software as part of the development of our products, including design automation tools for hardware, embedded software, optimized software tools and libraries that extend the reach of our platforms to software and AI developers. Through our R&D efforts, we were able to introduce a number of new products and enhance our IP core offerings and software.\n\nWe also work with industry leaders on process technology, design tools, intellectual property, software and other industry consortia to conduct early-stage R&D. We are also actively contributing to numerous industry open-source software initiatives across a broad range of technologies. We conduct product and system R&D activities for our products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams located in various countries who undertake specific activities at the direction of our U.S. headquarters.\n\n9\n\nTable of Contents\n\nManufacturing Arrangements and Assembly and Test Facilities\n\nThird-Party Wafer Foundry Facilities\n\nWe utilize Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) for the production of wafers for our HPC, FPGA and Adaptive SoC products and GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF), with respect to wafer purchases for our HPC products at the 12 nm and 14 nm technology nodes. Additionally, we utilize TSMC, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. for the production of our ICs in the form of programmable logic devices.\n\nOther Third-Party Manufacturers\n\nWe outsource board-level graphics product manufacturing to third-party manufacturers.\n\nAssembly, Test, Mark and Packaging Facilities\n\nWafers for our products are either sorted by the foundry or delivered by the foundry to our assembly, test, mark and packaging (ATMP) partners or subcontractors located in the Asia-Pacific region who package and test our final semiconductor products. We are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The ATMP JVs, Siliconware Precision Industries Ltd. (SPIL) and King Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) provide ATMP services for our products.\n\nIntellectual Property and Licensing\n\nWe rely on contracts and intellectual property rights to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized third-party copying and use. Intellectual property rights include copyrights, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets and mask work rights. As of December 28, 2024, we had approximately 7,500 patents in the United States and approximately 1,900 patent applications pending in the United States. In certain cases, we have filed corresponding applications in foreign jurisdictions. Including United States and foreign matters, we have approximately 18,800 patent matters worldwide consisting of approximately 13,200 issued patents and 5,600 patent applications pending. We expect to file future patent applications in both the United States and abroad on significant inventions, as we deem appropriate. We do not believe that any individual patent, or the expiration of any patent, is or would be material to our business. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have numerous cross-licensing and technology exchange agreements with other companies under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property rights. We have acquired various licenses from external parties to certain technologies that are implemented in our products, including our IP cores and devices. These licenses support our continuing ability to make and sell our products. We have also acquired licenses to certain proprietary software, open-source software, and related technologies, such as compilers, for our design tools. Continued use of such software and technology is important to the operation of the design tools upon which our customers depend\n.\n\nBacklog\n\nSales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time. Although such orders or agreements may provide visibility into future quarters, they may not necessarily be indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period as some of these orders or agreements may be revised or canceled without penalty.\n\nSeasonality\n\nOur operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends.\n\nHuman Capital\n\nAs of December 28, 2024, we had approximately 28,000 employees in our global workforce. We believe we are at our best when our culture of innovation, creative minds and people from all kinds of backgrounds work together in an engaging and open environment. Areas of focus for us include the following:\n\nMission, Culture, and Engagement\n\nOur History - Founded in 1969 as a Silicon Valley start-up, the AMD journey began with dozens of employees focused on leading-edge semiconductor products. From those modest beginnings, we have grown into a global\n\n10\n\nTable of Contents\n\ncompany achieving many important industry firsts along the way. Today, we develop high-performance and adaptive computing to solve some of the world’s toughest and most interesting challenges.\n\nOur Vision - High performance and adaptive computing is transforming our lives.\n\nOur Mission - Build great products that accelerate next-generation computing experiences.\n\nOur employees are driven by this vision and mission. Innovation occurs when creative minds and diverse perspectives from all over the world work together. This is the foundation of our unique culture and the reason we believe our employees are among the most engaged in our industry.\n\nWe conduct an annual survey of our global workforce to measure our culture, engagement, and workplace experience. The results are reviewed by our Board of Directors and acted upon by our senior leadership team. Results from our 2024 survey reported scores that continued to be among the very best for global companies in the technology industry. Our employees described our culture as inclusive, innovative, open, and respectful, and rated the quality of our managers high, and employment engagement is among the top 10% of our high-performing technology industry peers.\n\nDiversity, Belonging and Inclusion (DB&I)\n\nOur diverse and inclusive workforce encourages employees to share their opinions and different perspectives. We believe that building a diverse talent pipeline, encouraging a culture of respect and belonging, and increasing inclusion of unique and underrepresented voices makes our company stronger. Our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), which are open to all our employees, encourage employee engagement and play an important role in our culture. More than 85% of all new hires join at least one of AMD’s ERGs when starting employment. In 2024, we continued to focus on developing our female engineering community through mentoring opportunities and expanding the program, “Advancing Women in Technology,” that aims to support the career development of women in technical careers at AMD.\n\nTotal Rewards\n\nWe invest in our workforce by offering competitive salaries, incentives, and benefits to ensure that we continue to attract and retain the industry’s best and brightest in an equitable manner. We regularly review our compensation practices, considering factors relevant to ensuring equitable pay such as an employee’s role, experience, skills, and performance. We also benchmark set pay ranges based on relevant market data and our overall workforce. We focus on flexibility and choice in our benefits that resonate with a multi-generational workforce as well as offering inclusive benefits that support our DB&I objectives, such as global parental and bereavement leave, and financial assistance to build a family through adoption or surrogacy. While we believe that there is unique collaboration that can occur when employees meet in person, we embrace flexibility with hybrid and remote work as options for our employees.\n\nWe have a strong pay for performance culture that we believe drives superior results. Our employees have benefited from our robust financial results through our strong short-term and long-term incentive programs. Our rewards programs enable us to attract, retain and motivate our workforce.\n\nDevelopment\n\nWe offer our employees opportunities to advance their careers at the Company and the majority of our new leaders are promoted from within. We are focused on leadership progression and encourage our employees to take advantage of new opportunities. Our manager and leadership development programs are highly rated, and we provide specialized development programs for our employees as well as educational assistance in the form of tuition reimbursement for eligible employees to continue their university education or achieve advanced certifications.\n\nWe have an enterprise-wide mentoring program where\nemployees have the opportunity to learn from experienced colleagues, develop new skills, and build their professional networks. The program also supports effective onboarding, helping new hires more quickly acclimate to our company culture and work processes. We believe that our mentoring program is a valuable investment in our workforce, and we are committed to its ongoing success.\n\n11\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEmployee Voice\n\nAt AMD, we value the importance of employee voice and actively engage in efforts to ensure that our employees' opinions and perspectives are heard and considered. Our employee voice strategy includes an annual AMDer Survey (engagement survey). Our scores rank AMD in the top 10% of high-tech firms on similar questions, categories and overall score. Additionally, we measure effectiveness across all elements of the employee lifecycle, including onboarding, exit, and regularly seek out employee feedback on areas including benefits and total rewards satisfaction. Further, our executive team holds frequent employee roundtables, town halls and global team meetings with question-and-answer segments which facilitate open communication and feedback from our workforce.\n\nGovernment Regulations\n\nOur global operations are subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, those relating to export control, customs, intellectual property, data privacy and security, climate, environmental, health and safety requirements, cybersecurity, tax, employment, competition and anti-trust, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, conflict minerals, corporate governance, financial and other disclosures, and AI. Compliance with these governmental laws and regulations do not presently have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. However, compliance with changes to existing or new regulations may have a material adverse impact on our future capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. In addition, the failure to comply with government laws and regulations may subject us to consequences including fines, limits on our ability to sell our products, suspension of certain of our business activities, reputational damage, criminal and civil liabilities, and sanctions, which may have a material adverse effect on our\ncapital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.\nFor additional information about government regulations applicable to our business, and their potential impacts see Risk Factors in Item 1A.\n\nEnvironmental Regulations\n\nOur operations and properties are subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and the manufacturing processes of our products, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. These laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtain permits for operations in making our products, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and tend to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union (EU) and China are among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. Jurisdictions including the EU, Australia, California and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits.\n\nCertain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or the Superfund Act, impose strict or, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. We have been named as a responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981, we have discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979.\n\nIn 1991, we received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. We have entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. We remain responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements.\n\n12\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTo address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $5.5 million and have not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change. We believe that any amount in addition to what has already been accrued would not be material.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nAMD was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on May 1, 1969 and became a publicly held company in 1972.

Contents\n\nEconomic and Strategic Risks\n\nIntel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively on a level playing field.\n\nIntel’s microprocessor market share position, significant financial resources, introduction of competitive new products, and existing relationships with top-tier OEMs have enabled it to market and price its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past resulted in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affected our margins and profitability. Intel also dominates the computer system platform and has a heavy influence on PC manufacturers, other PC industry participants, and benchmarks. It is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards. We may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions designed to limit our market share and margins; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; and exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers, retailers and channel partners. We expect Intel to continue to heavily invest substantial resources in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies.\n\nNvidia’s dominance in the graphics processing unit market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively on a level playing field.\n\nNvidia’s Data Center GPU market share position, significant financial resources, introduction of competitive new products and proprietary software ecosystem have enabled it to market and price its products in a manner to encourage the selection of Nvidia-based systems and to influence customers who do business with us. We may be materially adversely affected by Nvidia’s business practices, including allocation strategies and pricing actions; product mix and introduction schedules; and product bundling strategies. Nvidia’s practices can limit customers’ ability to choose non-Nvidia products, including our products, and in turn, may limit our market share and decrease our margins and profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We expect Nvidia to continue to heavily invest substantial resources in research and development, marketing and other technology companies.\n\nThe markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive and rapidly evolving.\n\nThe markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive and rapidly evolving. We expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, new and evolving industry standards, changing customer preferences and requirements, and frequent introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products that may provide better performance/experience or that may include additional features that render our products comparatively less competitive.\n\nIn addition, we are entering markets with current and new competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. For example, the AI market is subject to rapid technological change, product obsolescence, frequent new product introductions and feature enhancements, changes in end-user requirements and evolving industry trends and legal standards. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets or superior ability to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. While we see significant opportunity in AI, we expect intense competition from companies such as Nvidia in the supply of GPUs and other accelerators for the AI market. We may face competition from some of our customers who internally develop the same products as us. Increased adoption of Arm-based semiconductor designs could lead to further growth and development of the Arm ecosystem. We may also face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to invest significantly greater resources in research and development than anticipated. In addition, the semiconductor industry has seen several mergers and acquisitions over the last number of years. Further consolidation could adversely impact our business due to there being fewer suppliers, customers and partners in the industry.\n\n16\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe believe that the main factors that determine our product competitiveness are total cost of ownership, timely product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities (including accelerations for key workloads such as AI, energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life, given their impact on total cost of ownership), reliability, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), level of integration, software and hardware compatibility, ease of use and functionality of software design tools, completeness of applicable software solutions, security and stability, brand recognition and availability. If competitors introduce competitive new products into the market before us, demand for our products could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected. Further, our competitors have significant marketing and sales resources which could increase the competitive environment in a declining market or during challenging economic times, leading to lower prices and a reduction in our margins. To the extent our competitors introduce competitive new products and technologies into the market before we do, or introduce products and technologies that provide better performance/experience or at better prices, our products and technologies may be comparatively less competitive and our competitive position may weaken, which could adversely harm our business and results of operations.\n\nFrom time to time, governments provide incentives or make other investments that could benefit and give a competitive advantage to our competitors. For example, the United States government enacted the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America and Science Act (CHIPS Act) of 2022 to provide financial incentives to the U.S. semiconductor industry. Government incentives, including the CHIPS Act, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If our competitors can benefit from such government incentives and we cannot, it could strengthen our competitors’ relative position and have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that have materially adversely affected, and may continue to materially adversely affect, our business in the future.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns, often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change, wide fluctuations in supply and demand, continuous new product introductions, price erosion and declines in general economic conditions. We have incurred substantial losses in previous downturns, due to substantial declines in average selling prices; the cyclical nature of supply and demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry; a decline in demand for end-user products that incorporate our products; and excess inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment. Such industry-wide fluctuations may materially adversely affect us in the future. Global economic uncertainty and weakness have in the past impacted the semiconductor market as consumers and businesses have deferred purchases, which negatively impacted demand for our products. Our financial performance has been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by these downturns. The growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from high-growth adjacent emerging global markets. Our ability to be successful in such markets depends in part on our ability to establish adequate local infrastructure, as well as our ability to cultivate and maintain local relationships in these markets. If demand from these markets is below our expectations, sales of our products may decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nThe demand for our products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nIndustry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. We offer products that are used in different end markets and the demand for our products can vary among our Data Center, Client, Gaming and Embedded end markets. For instance, in our Data Center segment, we offer products that are optimized for generative AI applications and since the fourth quarter of 2023, we have experienced significant demand for our AI accelerators. The demand for such products in part will depend on the extent to which our customers utilize generative AI solutions in a wide variety of applications, and both the near-term and long-term trajectory of such generative AI solutions is unknown. Also, our Client segment revenue is focused on the consumer desktop and notebook PC segments and will depend in part on the market’s adoption of AI PCs. We are actively building AI capabilities into all our Client products, such as Ryzen AI PC processors, but there can be no assurance about the rate and pace of adoption of such product offerings. In the past, revenues from the Client and Gaming segments have experienced a decline driven by, among other factors, the adoption of smaller and other form factors, increased competition and changes in replacement cycles.\n\n17\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIn addition, our GPU revenue in the past has been affected in part by the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market (including potential actions by global monetary authorities), our GPU business could be materially adversely affected. The success of our semi-custom SoC products in our Gaming segment is dependent on securing customers for our semi-custom design pipeline and consumer market conditions, including the success of game console systems and next generation consoles for Sony and Microsoft. Our Embedded segment primarily includes embedded CPUs and GPUs, APUs, FPGAs and Adaptive SoC products some of which are subject to macroeconomic trends and volatile business conditions. To the extent our embedded customers are faced with higher inventory levels, they may choose to draw down their existing inventory and order less of our products. For example, our Embedded segment revenue decreased in 2024 as customers continued to normalize their inventory levels.\n\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions.\n\nOur success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to identify industry changes, and adapt our strategy to develop, qualify and distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry trends and requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis, are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet the evolving needs of industry changes or that our efforts to execute our product roadmap will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. If we fail to or are delayed in identifying, developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends, or if we fail to predict which new form factors, product features preferences or requirements consumers will adopt and adapt our business accordingly, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis or that they will be well-received by our customers. Moreover, our investments in new products and technologies involve certain risks and uncertainties and could disrupt our ongoing business. New investments may not generate sufficient revenue, may incur unanticipated liabilities and may divert our limited resources and distract management from our current operations. We cannot be certain that our ongoing investments in new products and technologies will be successful, will meet our expectations and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results. For example, as part of our pervasive AI strategy, we have a portfolio of hardware products and software tools to allow our customers to develop scalable and pervasive AI solutions. We are actively building AI capabilities into our products, but there can be no assurance about the rate and pace of adoption of such product offerings. In our Data Center segment, we offer products that are optimized for generative AI applications and since the fourth quarter of 2023, we have experienced significant demand for our AI accelerators. The demand for such products in part will depend on the extent to which our customers utilize generative AI solutions in a wide variety of applications, and both the near-term and long-term trajectory of such generative AI solutions is unknown. If we fail to develop and timely offer or deploy such products and technologies, keep pace with the product offerings of our competitors, or adapt to unexpected changes in industry standards or disruptive technological innovation, our business could be adversely affected. Additionally,\nour efforts in developing new AI technology solutions are inherently risky and may not always succeed.\nWe may incur significant costs, resources, investments and delays and not achieve a return on investment or capitalize on the opportunities presented by demand for AI solutions. Moreover, while AI adoption is likely to continue and may accelerate, the\nlong-term trajectory of this technological trend is uncertain.\n\n18\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDelays in developing, qualifying or shipping new products can also cause us to miss our customers’ product design windows or, in some cases, breach contractual obligations. If our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems or products, they will typically not use our products in their systems or products until at least the next design configuration. The process of being qualified for inclusion in a customer’s system or product can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business. We also depend on the success and timing of our customers’ platform launches. If our customers delay their product launches or if our customers do not effectively market their platforms with our products, it could result in a delay in bringing our products to market and cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which could materially adversely affect our business. The increasing frequency and complexity of our newly introduced products may result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could result in product delays. In addition, market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. Over the life of a specific product, the sale price is typically reduced over time. The introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products is necessary to maintain the overall corporate average selling price. If we are unable to introduce new products with sufficiently high sale prices or to increase unit sales volumes capable of offsetting the reductions in the sale prices of existing products over time, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\nThe loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nWe depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our business, and we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant part of our revenue and receivables in the future. If one of our key customers decides to stop buying our products, materially reduces its operations or its demand for our products, or has operations that are materially impaired for a significant period of time such that it is unable to receive or utilize our products, or pay its liabilities, our business would be materially adversely affected.\n\nEconomic and market uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results.\n\nUncertain global or regional economic conditions have and may in the future adversely impact our business. Uncertainty in the economic environment or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions, such as inflation, higher interest rates, recession, slowing growth, increased unemployment, tighter credit markets, changes in fiscal monetary or trade policy, or currency fluctuations, may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to stop or postpone purchases. For example, our Embedded segment revenue decreased in 2024 as customers continued to normalize their inventory levels. During challenging economic times, our current or potential future customers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products. Additionally, if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that they owe us. The risk related to our customers potentially defaulting on or delaying payments to us is increased because we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of our revenue. Any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. Moreover, our key suppliers may reduce their output or become insolvent, thereby adversely impacting our ability to manufacture our products. Adverse changes in economic conditions could increase costs of memory, equipment, materials or substrates and other supply chain expenses. If we are not able to procure a stable supply of materials on an ongoing basis and at reasonable costs to meet our production requirements, we could experience a supply shortage or an increase in production costs, which could negatively impact our gross margin and materially adversely affect our business. Our ability to forecast our operating results, make business decisions and execute our business strategy could be adversely impacted by challenging macroeconomic conditions. In addition, uncertain economic conditions could lead to higher borrowing costs and reduced availability of capital and credit markets, making it more difficult for us to raise funds through borrowings or private or public sales of debt or equity securities. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty could also lead to failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments and declines in the value of our financial instruments. If a banking institution in which we hold funds fails or is subject to significant adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets, we could be subject to a risk of loss of all or a portion of such uninsured funds or be subject to a delay in accessing all or a portion of such uninsured funds, which in turn could adversely impact our short-term liquidity and ability to meet our operating expense obligations.\n\n19\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOur operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns.\n\nThe profile of our sales may be weighted differently during the year. A large portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. In addition, our operating results tend to vary seasonally with the markets in which our products are sold. For example, historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends. Many of the factors that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trends are beyond our control.\n\nIf we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses.\n\nWe rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks and common law rights, such as trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third-party infringement or from misappropriation in the United States and abroad. Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated, expire, or circumvented or rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us.\n\nFurthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or, if a patent is issued, the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. In addition, it is difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost-effective manner. In jurisdictions where foreign laws provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the U.S. and abroad, our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised, and our business would be materially adversely affected.\n\nUnfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us.\n\nWe have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue, affecting our profitability and cash flows. Whenever we believe appropriate, we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We determine our total foreign currency exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as payroll. We cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, the majority of our product sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the local currency can cause increases or decreases in the cost of our products in the local currency of such customers. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our products.\n\nOperational and Technology Risks\n\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\nWe utilize third-party wafer foundries to fabricate the silicon wafers for all of our products. We rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) for the production of all wafers for microprocessor and GPU products at 7 nanometer (nm) or smaller nodes, and we rely primarily on GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) for wafers for microprocessor and GPU products manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nm. We also utilize TSMC, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. for our integrated circuits (IC) in the form of programmable logic devices. We also rely on third-party manufacturers to assemble, test, mark and pack (ATMP) our products. Our third-party package assembly partners are responsible for packaging technology used to fabricate our products. It is important to have reliable relationships with all of these third-party manufacturing suppliers to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand.\n\n20\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe cannot guarantee that these manufacturers or our other third-party manufacturing suppliers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements. If we experience supply constraints from our third-party manufacturing suppliers, we may be required to allocate the reduced quantities of affected products amongst our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with these customers and on our financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing suppliers, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, if TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our microprocessor and GPU products at 7 nm or smaller nodes and our newest IC products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain many of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. The manufacturers we use also fabricate wafers and ATMP products for other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require onerous prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we overestimate our customer demand or experience a decrease in customer demand, either could result in excess inventory and an increase in our production costs. We are party to a wafer supply agreement with GF where GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us and set pricing through 2026. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations.\n\nOther risks associated with our dependence on third-party manufacturers include limited control over delivery schedules, yield, cycle times, quality assurance, price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our intellectual property, dependence on several subcontractors, and limited ability to manage inventory and parts. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers (or their subcontractors) suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, water shortages, or high heat events, lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our products, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain environmental, social, atmospheric or natural, economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. For example, in the first quarter of 2024, we experienced some inventory loss due to an incident at a contract manufacturer. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supply of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.\n\nIf we transition the production of some of our products to new manufacturers, we may experience delayed product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those manufacturers, we may be unable to timely secure an alternative supply for any specific product. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n21\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIf essential equipment, materials, substrates or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected.\n\nWe may purchase equipment, materials and substrates for use by our back-end manufacturing service providers from a number of suppliers and our operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of adequate supplies of equipment and materials of acceptable quality on a timely basis. Our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials of acceptable quality in the manufacture of our products. In addition, as many of our products increase in technical complexity, we rely on our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order to continue meeting our back-end manufacturing needs. Certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers, or in some cases, a sole supplier. We also depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of IC packages for our microprocessors, including our APU products. Similarly, certain non-proprietary materials or components such as memory, printed circuit boards (PCBs), interposers, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of suppliers. If we are unable to procure a stable supply of memory, equipment, materials or substrates of acceptable quality on an ongoing basis and at reasonable costs to meet our production requirements, we could experience a shortage in memory, equipment, materials or substrate supply or an increase in production costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements with some of our suppliers. If the delivery of such supply is delayed or does not occur for any reason, it could materially impact our ability to procure and process the required volume of supply to meet customer demand. Conversely, if we overestimate our customer demand or experience a decrease in customer demand, either because customers cancel orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, it could result in excess inventory and an increase in our production costs, particularly since we have prepayment arrangements with certain suppliers. Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our third-party manufacturers purchase are complex, it is sometimes difficult to substitute one equipment or materials supplier for another.\n\nFrom time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Also, some of these materials and components may be subject to rapid changes in price, quality and availability. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party manufacturers are unable to procure materials for manufacturing our products, our business would be materially adversely affected.\n\nFailure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our results of operations.\n\nSemiconductor manufacturing yields are a result of product design, process technology and packaging technology, which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer, and low yields can result from design failures, packaging technology failures, process technology failures or a combination of some or all of these. Our third-party manufacturers are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. If our third-party manufacturers experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during production, we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or we may experience product delivery delays. We cannot be certain that our third-party manufacturers will be able to develop, expand, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge manufacturing process or packaging technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes earlier. Moreover, during periods when our third-party manufacturers are implementing new process or packaging technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. For example, we are presently focusing our 7 nm and lower product microprocessor and GPU portfolio on TSMC’s processes. If TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our products at 7 nm or smaller nodes in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, we rely on TSMC, UMC and our other foundries to produce wafers with competitive performance attributes for our IC products. Therefore, the foundries, particularly TSMC which manufactures our newest IC products, must be able to transition to advanced manufacturing process technologies and increased wafer sizes, produce wafers at acceptable yields and deliver them in a timely manner.\n\nAny decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business.\n\n22\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOur revenue from our semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into customers’ products and the success of those products.\n\nThe revenue that we receive from our semi-custom SoC products is in the form of non-recurring engineering fees charged to third parties for design and development services and revenue received in connection with sales of our semi-custom SoC products to these third parties. As a result, our ability to generate revenue from our semi-custom products depends on our ability to secure customers for our semi-custom design pipeline, our customers’ desire to pursue the project and our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into those customers’ products. Any revenue from sales of our semi-custom SoC products is directly related to sales of the third-party’s products and reflective of their success in the market. Moreover, we have no control over the marketing efforts of these third parties, and we cannot make any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current or future years. Consequently, the semi-custom SoC product revenue expected by us may not be fully realized and our operating results may be adversely affected.\n\nOur products may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nThe products that we sell are complex and have been and may in the future be subject to security vulnerabilities that could result in, among other things, the loss, corruption, theft or misuse of confidential data or system performance issues. Our efforts to prevent and address security vulnerabilities may decrease performance, be only partially effective or not successful at all. We may depend on vendors to create mitigations to their technology that we incorporate into our products and they may delay or decline to make such mitigations. We may also depend on third parties, such as customers and end users, to deploy our mitigations alone or as part of their own mitigations, and they may delay, decline or modify the implementation of such mitigations. Our relationships with our customers could be adversely affected as some of our customers may stop purchasing our products, reduce or delay future purchases of our products, or use competing products. Any of these actions by our customers could adversely affect our revenue. We have and may in the future be subject to claims and litigation related to security vulnerabilities. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities of our products may subject us to adverse publicity, damage to our brand and reputation, and could materially harm our business or results of operations.\n\nIT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyberattacks could disrupt operations and compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate or cause significant damage to our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur business relies on technology hardware, software, cloud services, infrastructure, networks and systems (collectively, IT Systems). We own and manage some IT Systems but also rely on critical third-party IT Systems, products and services. In the ordinary course of business, we and various third-party providers and business partners process and maintain sensitive data, including personal information about workers, customers and others, as well as intellectual property and proprietary or confidential information relating to our business and that of our customers and business partners (collectively, Confidential Data). Maintaining the availability, integrity and security of our IT Systems and Confidential Data is critical to our business and reputation. While we and others have implemented various controls and defenses, AMD and companies like AMD and our vendors and customers have been and are increasingly subject to cybersecurity attacks, risks and threats. Threat factors range in sophistication from individual hackers and insiders to ransom gangs and state-sponsored attackers. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our IT Systems or supply chain. The increased prevalence of remote working arrangements at AMD and our providers present additional operational risks and attack vectors to our IT Systems. Our IT Systems and Confidential Data are vulnerable to a range of cybersecurity risks and threats, including malicious code that is added to widely available open-source software, compromised commercial software or security vulnerabilities in our products or systems, or those of a third party, that are being used by attackers prior to mitigations being put in place, such as zero-day attacks. Cyberattacks have and may come into our IT Systems through the compromise of users’ access credentials. Users’ access credentials can be compromised by phishing, vishing, smishing, multi-factor authentication (MFA) prompt bombing, hacking, or other social engineering, cybersecurity, or theft activities.\n\n23\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThreat actors are also increasingly using tools and techniques that circumvent controls, evade detection, and remove forensic evidence, which means that we and others may be unable to implement adequate preventative measures against, anticipate, detect, deflect, contain or recover from cyberattacks in a timely or effective manner. As AI capabilities improve and are increasingly adopted, we may see more sophisticated threats created through the use of AI technology to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated cyberattacks. These attacks could be crafted with an AI tool to directly attack IT Systems with increased speed and/or efficiency than a human threat actor or create more effective phishing emails. In addition, the threat could be introduced from the result of our or our customers and business partners incorporating the output of an AI tool that includes a threat, such as introducing malicious code by incorporating AI generated source code. Our network and storage applications, as well as those of our customers, business partners, and third-party providers, may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions.\n\nCyberattacks that breach our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, customers or business partners, could result in any or all of the following, which individually or collectively could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position; unauthorized access to, misuse or disclosure of Confidential Data (such as intellectual property, sensitive business information or personally identifiable information (PII)); reputational harm and/or diminution in our competitiveness; loss of existing and/or future customers; litigation and/or regulatory investigations or enforcement; significant remediation, restoration and compliance costs; and the diversion of management’s attention and key information technology resources. In addition, many governments have enacted and are continuing to enact strict privacy and security laws, such as the UK’s and European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which provide for fines, penalties, and in the case of the CCPA and similar legislation, the basis for private claims for certain types of data breaches. We anticipate ongoing and increasing costs related to enhancing and implementing information security controls, including costs related to upgrading application, computer, and network security components; training workers to maintain and monitor our security controls; investigating, responding to and remediating any data security breach, and addressing any related litigation or regulatory proceedings; mitigating reputational harm; and complying with external regulations.\n\nUncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. We generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers’ estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is further complicated when our products are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributors and customers, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties throughout the downstream channel. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. For example, our Embedded segment revenue decreased in 2024 as customers continued to normalize their inventory levels. We may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products.\n\nExcess or obsolete inventory have resulted in, and may in the future result in, write-downs of the value of our inventory. Factors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, a reduction in the average selling price, or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.\n\n24\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOur ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner includes the use of third-party intellectual property.\n\nIn the design and development of new and enhanced products, we rely on third-party intellectual property such as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties that we incorporate into our software or hardware. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and greater functionality from semiconductor products may exceed the capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, or laws are adopted that affect our use of third party intellectual property in certain regions or products, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\nWe depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software, memory and other computer platform components to support our business and products.\n\nWe depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, graphics cards, software (e.g., BIOS, operating systems, drivers, AI models or tools), memory and other components that we use to design, support and sell, and our customers utilize to support and/or use our product offerings. We also rely on our AIB partners to support our products. In addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other components cease or reduce their design, manufacture or production of current or future products that are based on, utilized in, or support our products, or laws are adopted that result in the same, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\nIf we lose Microsoft Corporation’s support for our products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our x86-based microprocessor products. With respect to our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent software providers designing and developing software to run on our products. If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets or does not continue to develop and maintain their operating systems to support our graphics products, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by Microsoft. If Microsoft did not certify a driver, or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of Microsoft or other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks.\n\nWe market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice. These agreements are non-exclusive and permit both our distributors and AIB partners to offer our competitors’ products. We are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors’ products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. We extend credit to certain of our distributors and AIB partners. If we are unable to collect accounts receivable from our significant distributors and/or AIB partners or incur higher allowances for credit losses, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB partners or offer appropriate incentives to focus them on the sale of our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\n25\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAdditionally, distributors and AIB partners typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book that is less than 12 months older than the manufacturing date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline.\n\nOur business depends on the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\n\nWe rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to our business. Our business processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks. As such, our information systems will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time.\n\nThese changes may also require changes in our information systems, modification of internal control procedures and significant training of employees and third-party resources. We continuously work on simplifying our information systems and applications through consolidation and standardization efforts. There can be no assurance that our business and operations will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition. Our information technology systems, and those of third-party information technology providers or business partners, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control including catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, viruses or malware, cyberattacks, insider threat attacks, unauthorized system or data modifications, data breaches and computer system or network failures, exposing us to significant cost, reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business.\n\nIn addition, as our IT environment continues to evolve, we are embracing new ways of communicating and sharing data internally and externally with customers and partners using methods such as mobility and the cloud that can promote business efficiency. However, these practices can also result in a more distributed IT environment, making it more difficult for us to maintain visibility and control over internal and external users, and meet scalability and administrative requirements. If our security controls cannot keep pace with the speed of these changes or if we are not able to meet regulatory and compliance requirements, our business would be materially adversely affected.\n\nIf our products are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur products may not be fully compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware. Further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. If our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nCosts related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nProducts as complex as those we offer may contain defects or failures when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released. We cannot assure you that, despite our testing procedures, errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments in the future, which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, material recall and replacement costs, loss of revenue, writing down the inventory of defective products, the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts, defending against litigation related to defective products or related liabilities, including property damage, personal injury, damage to our reputation in the industry and loss of data or intangible property, and could adversely affect our relationships with our customers. In addition, we may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field. As a result, we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to correct defects. Any of these problems could materially adversely affect our business.\n\n26\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe could be subject to potential product liability claims if one of our products causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury, whether tangible or intangible. Claims may be made by consumers or others selling our products, and we may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions of others. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nIf we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain as we respond to changes in customer demand for our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to meet customer demand for our products depends, in part, on our ability to deliver the products our customers want on a timely basis. Accordingly, we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing, distribution and fulfillment of our products. As we continue to grow our business, expand to high-growth adjacent markets, acquire new customers and strengthen relationships with existing customers, the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because many of our customers tend to have specific requirements for particular products, geographic requirements, and specific time-frames in which they require delivery of these products. If we are unable to consistently deliver the right products to our customers on a timely basis in the right locations, our customers may reduce the quantities they order from us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe outsource to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including portions of our product distribution, transportation management and information technology support services.\n\nWe rely on third-party providers to operate our regional product distribution centers and to manage the transportation of our work-in-process and finished products among our facilities, to our third-party manufacturers and to our customers. In addition, we rely on third parties to provide certain information technology services to us, including help desk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, data center operations, database administration and voice, video and remote access. We cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case our internal operations and the distribution of our products to our customers could be materially adversely affected. Also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third-party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition these functions in-house or secure new providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business if the transition is not executed appropriately.\n\nOur inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nWe market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third-party distributors. From time to time, our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the “gray market.” Our inability to control gray market activities could result in customer satisfaction issues because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channels there is a risk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or are used products represented as new. Additionally, products acquired on the gray market or through other unauthorized channels are at higher risk of being re-sold to prohibited end-users, misused, and deployed for uses that do not align with AMD’s ethics, values or compliance standards. Gray market products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, making it difficult to forecast demand accurately. Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channels compete with these heavily discounted gray market products, which adversely affects demand for our products and negatively impacts our margins.\n\n27\n\nTable of Contents\n\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\n\nClimate change may have an adverse impact on our business and the business of our suppliers and customers. Global climate change may result in certain natural disasters and climate-related events occurring with increasing frequency and severity and its physical impact on the major regions where we have operations has the potential to disrupt our business and those of our customers and suppliers. Our headquarters and some of our operations and facilities are located in areas\nthat are susceptible to earthquakes and tsunamis, wildfires, extreme storms, extreme heat, drought, freezing, tropical cyclones and other natural disasters. Water and energy availability and reliability in the regions where we have facilities and where our suppliers have operations is important to our business. Certain natural disasters, including drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise and flooding could disrupt our operations and our suppliers’ or customers’ operations, including by disrupting, the availability of energy or water necessary for the operations of our business or those of our suppliers and customers. Global climate change is also resulting in chronic changes that result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, which could disrupt our operations, or the operations of our third parties. Such disruptions could cause delays in manufacturing or shipping our products, affect our supply chain and may result in the loss of business, and additional costs to maintain or resume operations, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operation. We may also experience contractual disputes relating to supply chain delays resulting from climate change related disruptions, which could result in increased litigation and costs.\nData centers depend on access to clean water and reliable energy, thus potential power or water shortages could impair our customers’ ability to expand their data center capacity and consume our products and services, which in turn could adversely impact our ability to generate revenue.\n\nAlthough we maintain insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on coverage, availability and cost. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions. Additionally, our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nOur business and the business of our suppliers and customers may also be subject to climate-related regulations, and contract terms, and may be subject to additional regulations and contract terms and lawsuits in the future. New increased regulations regarding carbon taxes, greenhouse gas emissions, fuel or energy taxes and other climate-related risks will likely result in greater costs; for example, as a result of carbon pricing impacts on electrical utilities and/or necessitating that we purchase more renewable energy than otherwise planned. Our supply chain manufacturing suppliers may be exposed to increased costs of doing business should they be affected by new climate-related expectations such as those affecting abatement equipment, renewable energy, and/or alter production processes and materials selections. The additional compliance costs incurred by our suppliers may be passed on to us and result in greater indirect costs to us. These costs and restrictions could materially harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses, impacting our reputation if there is actual or perceived non-compliance, or requiring us to alter our operations and products. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the technology industry are unclear but could be severe. Additionally, we are or expect to be subject to various new or proposed climate-related disclosure requirements and we expect to incur costs and resources in order to comply. Failure to accurately comply with such reporting obligations may result in enforcement actions, reputational harm or private litigation that could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\n\nGovernment actions and regulations such as export regulations, tariffs, and trade protection measures may limit our ability to export our products to certain customers.\n\nWe have equity interests in two joint ventures (collectively, the THATIC JV) with Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd. (THATIC), a third-party Chinese entity. In June 2019, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the United States Department of Commerce added certain Chinese entities to the Entity List, including THATIC and the THATIC JV. Since that time, the United States administration has called for changes to domestic and foreign policy, including policies with respect to China and Russia. Specifically, United States-China trade relations remain uncertain as the United States continues to add more Chinese companies to the Entity List and more regulations targeted to advanced computing, semiconductor manufacturing, and emerging technologies such as AI. Further, the United States and other countries and coalitions have issued sanctions and revisions to export control and other regulations against Russia, Belarus and the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine, due to the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n28\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIn October 2023, BIS issued new requirements for certain advanced computing items that apply to the export of products classified ECCN 3A090 or 4A090 to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, any of Country Groups D1, D4 or D5, including China. These controls prevent us from shipping certain AMD Instinct™ integrated circuits and certain AMD Versal™ FPGAs to China, or to customers outside of the United States whose ultimate parent is headquartered in a D5 country (including China), without a license. These controls also require us to file a Notified Advanced Computing (NAC) notification with BIS 25 days before shipping certain Versal FPGAs to China, or to customers outside of the United States whose ultimate parent is headquartered in a D5 country (including China). The NAC notification process could result in BIS prohibiting a shipment or requiring a license application before shipping a product that is the subject of a NAC notification. BIS may issue new licensing requirements and regulatory controls in the future. Even new products that fall below the licensing thresholds may not be successful because we have no assurances BIS will agree that the alternative products are not subject to the new licensing requirements or that future regulations will not control the alternative products. A significant trade disruption or the establishment or increase of any tariffs, trade protection measures or restrictions, or retaliatory actions from foreign governments could result in lost sales adversely impacting our reputation and business. There is also a possibility of future tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export regulations or other restrictions imposed on our current and future products, customers, or suppliers by the United States, China or other countries that could have a material adverse effect on our business. New export control restrictions may adversely impact the ability of our research and development teams located outside of the United States from executing our product roadmaps in a timely manner or at all. In addition, deemed export restrictions could further affect our ability to provide services or develop products in the United States.\n\nUnited States export control regulations include restrictions or prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain AI technologies to United States embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities. If there are changes to those regulations, or to the categorization of our products under those regulations, our ability to sell our products and services outside the United States may be harmed. The United States and its allies continue to focus on export restrictions targeting semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products and services. The United States has imposed unilateral controls restricting GPUs and associated products, and in the future is likely to further adopt other unilateral or multilateral controls. The scope and application of such controls have been and may again be very broad, which may prohibit us from exporting or providing access to our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing and warehousing locations, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to meet demand abroad. If these export controls targeting semiconductors associated with AI including GPUs and associated products and services are further tightened, our ability to export our technology, products or services could be further restricted. We may be at a competitive disadvantage if our competitors are not subject to the same or similar restrictions. Additionally, such export controls have, and may in the future, subject downstream recipients of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale, repair or transfer of our products and may have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nWe may, from time to time, receive technical data from third parties that is subject to the International Traffic and Arms Regulations (ITAR), which are administered by the U.S. Department of State. Export Administration Regulation (EAR) governs the export and re-export of certain AMD products, including FPGAs, as well as the transfer of related technologies or provision of services, whether in the U.S. or abroad. We are required to maintain an internal compliance program and security infrastructure to meet EAR and ITAR requirements. An inability to obtain the required export licenses, or to predict when or pursuant to which conditions they will be granted, increases the difficulties of forecasting shipments. When we file license applications or Notification Advanced Computing (NAC) exception notices we have no assurance that BIS will grant any exemptions or licenses or that the BIS will act on the filings in a timely manner. Even if BIS grants a requested license, the license may come with burdensome conditions that we cannot or decide not to fulfill. In addition, security or compliance program failures that could result in penalties or a loss of export privileges, as well as stringent licensing restrictions that may make our products less attractive to overseas customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\n\nIf we cannot realize our deferred tax assets, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nOur deferred tax assets include net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Each quarter, we consider both positive and negative evidence to determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. If we determine that some or all of our deferred tax assets are not realizable, it could result in a material expense in the period in which this determination is made which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n29\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIn addition, a significant amount of our deferred tax assets related to net operating losses or tax credits which remain under a valuation allowance could be subject to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. The limitations could reduce our ability to utilize the net operating losses or tax credits before the expiration of the tax attributes.\n\nOur business is subject to potential tax liabilities, and exposure to greater-than-anticipated income tax liabilities as a result of changes in tax rules and regulations, changes in interpretation of tax rules and regulations, or unfavorable assessments from tax audits, could affect our effective tax rates, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. Any changes to tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our tax obligations and effective tax rate. Our income tax obligations could be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, changes to our corporate operating structure, intercompany arrangements, and tax planning strategies.\n\nOur income tax expense is computed based on tax rates enacted at the time of the respective financial period. Our future effective tax rates, financial condition and results from operations could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in the tax rules and regulations or the interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Many countries have implemented legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. The OECD is also continuing discussions surrounding fundamental changes in allocation of profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business, as well as the implementation of a global minimum tax (namely “Pillar One” and “Pillar Two”). Many countries we do business in have implemented laws based on Pillar Two, which may materially adversely impact our provision for income taxes, net income and cash flows. As a result of this heightened scrutiny, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to review and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or existing tax rulings, and may have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nIn addition, we are subject to examinations of our income tax returns by domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations. There can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our effective tax rates, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate income tax, indirect tax, or other tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure that the final determination of any tax audits or litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit, assessment or litigation, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash, tax provisions and results of operations in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\n\nWe are party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products.\n\nFrom time to time, we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions, as described in Note 18 - Contingencies of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. For example, we have been subject to certain claims concerning federal securities laws and corporate governance. Our products are purchased by and/or used by consumers, which could increase our exposure to consumer actions such as product liability claims and consumer class action claims. On occasion, we receive claims that individuals were allegedly exposed to substances used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facilities and that this alleged exposure caused harm. Litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and its outcome is uncertain. It is possible that if a claim is successfully asserted against us, it could result in the payment of damages that could be material to our business.\n\n30\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWith respect to intellectual property litigation, from time to time, we have been notified of, or third parties may bring or have brought, actions against us and/or against our customers based on allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others, contributing to or inducing the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, improperly claiming ownership of intellectual property or otherwise improperly using the intellectual property of others. If any such claims are asserted, we may seek to obtain a license under the third parties’ intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. These parties may file lawsuits against us or our customers seeking damages (potentially up to and including treble damages) or an injunction against the sale of products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted, which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to increase the costs of selling some of our products or which could damage our reputation. The award of damages, including material royalty payments, or other types of damages, or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products could have a material adverse effect on us. We could decide, in the alternative, to redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. Such challenges could be extremely expensive and time-consuming regardless of their merit, could cause delays in product release or shipment and/or could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded.\n\nEven if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nWe are subject to environmental laws, conflict minerals regulations, as well as a variety of other laws or regulations that could result in additional costs and liabilities.\n\nOur operations and properties are subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and the manufacturing processes of our products, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. In addition, our operations and those of our suppliers are further governed by regulations prohibiting the use of forced labor (e.g., mining conflict materials), and restrictions on other materials, as well as laws or regulations governing the operation of our facilities, sale and distribution of our products, and real property. For the manufacturing of our products, these laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtain permits for operations, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Although our management systems are designed to oversee our suppliers’ compliance, we cannot assure you that our suppliers have been or will be in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If our suppliers violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. Such non-compliance from our manufacturing suppliers could result in disruptions in supply, higher sourcing costs, and/or reputational damage for us. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used, stored, released, disposed of by us or located at, under or emanating from our current or former facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage. We have been named as a responsible party at three Superfund sites in Sunnyvale, California and we are subject to Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites and we have entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. We remain responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change. Although we have not been, we could be named a potentially responsible party at other Superfund or contaminated sites in the future. In addition, contamination that has not been identified could exist at our other facilities.\n\nFuture environmental legal requirements may become more stringent or costly. As such, the costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances may increase and could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n31\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEnvironmental laws are complex, change frequently and tend to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union (EU) and China are among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps, or produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory. Jurisdictions including the EU, Australia, California and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications, and the like, as well as additional energy consumption limits. Certain of our products may be excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us. We incur costs associated with complying with conflict minerals reporting requirements to our customers and the SEC. In addition to the SEC regulation, the EU, China and other jurisdictions are developing new policies focused on conflict minerals that may impact and increase the cost of our compliance program. Customers are increasingly seeking information about the source of minerals used in our supply chain beyond those addressed in laws and regulations. Given the complexity of mineral supply chains, we may be unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the subject minerals and thus our reputation may be harmed. Moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges to satisfy customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as “conflict free.” If we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor’s products. In addition, new or increased regulations limiting the use of such components, or regulation regarding greenhouse gas emissions and climate change-related risks, could increase our energy costs, for example as a result of carbon pricing impacts on electrical utilities and/or necessitating that we purchase more renewable energy than otherwise planned. Our supply chain manufacturing suppliers may be exposed to increased cost of doing business should they be affected by new climate-related regulations, for example, affecting abatement equipment, renewable energy, and/or alter production processes and materials selections.\n\nIn addition to our Company, customers, governments and authorities continue to focus on eliminating risks of forced labor in supply chains which may increase the cost of our compliance program. Several customers have also issued expectations to eliminate these occurrences, if any, that may impact us. While we have a Human Rights Policy and management systems to identify and avoid these practices in our supply chain, we cannot guarantee that our suppliers will always be in conformance with laws and expectations. Our failure to satisfy customer expectations on forced and trafficked labor policies may result in these customers choosing a competitor’s product or enforcement liability and reputational challenges.\n\nIn addition, many governments have enacted laws around PII, such as the GDPR and the CCPA, and the failure to comply could result in sanctions or other actions by the governments. The GDPR imposes significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance.\n\nNew emerging technology trends, such as AI, require us to keep pace with evolving regulations and industry standards. Given the complexity and rapid development of AI, there are various current and proposed regulatory frameworks relating to the use of AI in products and services. For example, the EU AI Act was adopted in 2024 and its implementation will be phased in over the next few years. In other jurisdictions, similar legislation is being considered. Such laws and regulations may impede our ability to offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with them. We expect that the legal and regulatory environment relating to emerging technologies such as AI will continue to develop and could increase the cost of doing business, and create compliance risks and potential liability, all which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Governments are also considering the new issues in intellectual property law that AI creates, which could result in different intellectual property rights in technology we create with AI and development processes and procedures and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n32\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEvolving expectations from governments, investors, customers and other stakeholders regarding corporate responsibility matters could result in additional costs, harm to our reputation and a loss of customers.\n\nThere are evolving expectations from governments, investors, customers and other stakeholders regarding corporate responsibility matters including those involving the environment and climate, energy and water consumption, diversity and inclusion, human rights and cybersecurity. Additionally, we are and expect to continue to be subject to various new and proposed climate-related and sustainability laws and requirements that may impact how we and our suppliers and customers conduct business or report on business by requiring the disclosure and tracking of greenhouse gas emissions, climate change-related risks and other sustainability matters related to our business. As the nature, scope and complexity of corporate responsibility reporting and disclosure requirements continue to evolve, we may incur additional compliance costs and indirect compliance costs from our customers and, suppliers that are passed on to us. In addition, certain corporate responsibility laws and regulations may require us to modify our business or supply chain in ways that are costly or less efficient. Emerging legal and regulatory requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, can be unpredictable, are subject to change, and may be difficult for us to comply with given the complexity of our supply chain and our outsourced manufacturing. For example, the state of California has passed reporting requirements that will require corporations to report on climate data and these laws include data assurance requirements that entail third-party verifications. Our failure to comply, or the appearance of our failure to comply, with these legal and regulatory requirements can result in regulatory penalties, fines and legal liabilities, increase costs, and harm our reputation – any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. While we have engaged, and in the future may continue to engage, in voluntary initiatives (such as voluntary disclosures, certifications, goals, or targets, among others) or commitments to improve our corporate responsibility profile and/or products or to respond to stakeholder expectations, such initiatives or achievement of such commitments may be costly, may not have the desired effect or may impact our reputation with other stakeholders and have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nFor example, we have publicly announced certain corporate responsibility goals spanning multiple topics informed by input from various of our stakeholders, including customers, investors and employees. These goals, which reflect our current plans and aspirations based on known conditions, may change in the future or may not be achieved, as they are subject to various challenges, risks and expectations such as standards, processes, and methodologies that continue to evolve or emerge, and many of these matters are outside our control. Our progress towards some goals receives third-party limited assurance and not reasonable assurance, or may rely on receipt of others’ information and data that may not be subject to either third-party limited or reasonable assurance. Any failure to achieve such goals, failure to achieve these goals within the set timeframe, or in the means expected, or the perception by stakeholders of such failure to achieve these goals may result in reputational or financial harm. Simultaneously, there are efforts by some stakeholders to reduce companies’ efforts on certain environmental, social and sustainability-related matters. Both advocates and opponents of environmental, social and sustainability matters are increasingly resorting to a range of activism forms, including media campaigns and litigation, to advance their perspectives. To the extent we are subject to such activism or litigation, it may require us to incur costs or otherwise adversely impact our business. Stakeholder groups may find our stated goals to be insufficiently responsive to the implications of issues, such as climate change, and any failure to set or achieve corporate responsibility initiatives that meet stakeholder expectations may result in loss of customers or in investors selling their shares, which could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n33\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIssues related to the responsible use of AI may result in reputational, competitive and financial harm and liability.\n\nWe offer products that include capabilities to support AI deployment and we expect this part of our business to grow. As with many new emerging technologies, AI presents risks and challenges and increasing legal, social and ethical concerns relating to its responsible use that could affect the adoption of AI, and thus our business. Third-party misuse of AI applications, models, or solutions, or ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by us or our customers, could cause harm to individuals or society and impair the public’s acceptance of AI. Moreover, we may be subject to competitive harm, regulatory action and legal liability as a result of new and proposed legislation regulating AI, as well as new applications of existing data protection, privacy and intellectual property and other laws. Such regulations and changes thereto could cause us to incur greater compliance costs, could impact our ability to sell or the ability of our customers and users worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our AI-related products and services and reduce the number of customers, which could negatively impact our business and financial results. As there continues to be an increasing focus on risks related to AI technologies, there may be an increasing focus on regulatory restrictions that target products and services that enable or facilitate AI and that may negatively impact some of our AI-related products and services. If the AI-related products that we offer have unintended consequences, infringe intellectual property rights or rights of publicity, or are misused by our customers or are otherwise controversial due to their perceived or actual impact on human rights, privacy, cybersecurity, employment or other social, economic or political issues the public’s acceptance of AI may be impaired and this may also result in reputational, competitive and financial harm and liability to our business.\n\nThe agreements governing our notes, our guarantee of the Assumed Xilinx Notes, and our Revolving Credit Agreement impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\n\nThe indenture governing our 3.924% Senior Notes due 2032 and 4.393% Senior Notes due 2052 contains various covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: create liens on certain assets to secure debt, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and consolidate with, merge into or sell, convey or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any other person.\n\nWe unconditionally guarantee, on a senior unsecured basis, Xilinx’s obligations under the Xilinx’s 2.375% Notes due 2030 (the Assumed Xilinx Notes). The supplemental indenture governing the Assumed Xilinx Notes also contain various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things, create certain liens on principal property or the capital stock of certain subsidiaries, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions with respect to principal property, and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all our assets, taken as a whole, to another person.\n\nWe also have an unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion (Revolving Credit Agreement). Our Revolving Credit Agreement contains various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things, incur liens; and consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety (in each case, except for certain customary exceptions). In addition, our Revolving Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter. The agreement governing our convertible notes and our Revolving Credit Agreement contains provisions whereby a payment default or acceleration under certain agreements with respect to other material indebtedness would result in cross defaults under our convertible indenture or the Revolving Credit Agreement and allow note holders or the lenders under our Revolving Credit Agreement to declare all amounts outstanding under certain of our indentures or the Revolving Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable. If the lenders under our Revolving Credit Agreement accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings.\n\nAlso, we enter into sale and factoring arrangements from time to time with respect to certain accounts receivables, which arrangements are non-recourse to us in the event that an account debtor fails to pay for credit-related reasons and are not included in our indebtedness. We could become obligated to repurchase such accounts receivables or otherwise incur liability to the counterparties under these arrangements under certain circumstances, such as where a commercial dispute arises between us and an account debtor.\n\n34\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMerger, Acquisition, Divestiture, and Integration Risks\n\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, and/or strategic investments, and the failure to integrate acquired businesses, may fail to materialize their anticipated benefits and could disrupt our business, which could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.\n\nWe have acquired and invested in businesses, and may continue to do so, that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand our product offerings and services and grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. Acquisitions and joint ventures include numerous risks including, but not limited to: our inability to identify suitable opportunities in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us; failure to complete a transaction in a timely manner, or at all; inability to obtain, or delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals or IP disputes or other litigation; difficulty in obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us or at all; and failure of a transaction to advance our business strategy or other unforeseen factors. For example, in August 2024, we completed our acquisition of Silo AI Oy (Silo AI), and we entered into an agreement to acquire ZT Group Int’l, Inc. (ZT Systems), which is currently expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Our ability to realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition depends on us successfully integrating the acquired business into our business. Any acquisitions we may undertake, including Silo AI and ZT Systems, involve certain integration risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to: difficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes or operations and integrating and retaining the employees including key personnel of the acquired business; diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention from our existing business; unanticipated costs or liabilities, such as increased interest expense and compliance with debt covenants or other obligations; coordinating and integrating in countries in which we have not previously operated; the potential impact of the acquisitions on our relationships with employees, vendors, suppliers and customers; our inability to effectively retain suppliers, vendors and customers of the acquired businesses; entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no experience; adverse changes in general economic conditions in regions in which we and the acquired companies operate; potential litigation associated with the acquisitions; difficulties in the assimilation of employees and culture; difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company; and difficulties with integrating and upgrading our and the acquired companies’ financial reporting systems. If we cannot successfully integrate or are delayed in integrating newly acquired businesses, it could negatively impact our ability to develop or sell new products and impair our ability to grow our business, which could materially adversely affect our financial conditions, results of operations or cash flows. Even if the businesses we acquire are successfully integrated, the benefits of such transactions may not be realized within the anticipated time frame or at all. To complete an acquisition, as contemplated by our intent to acquire ZT Systems, we may issue equity securities, which would dilute our stockholders’ ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and/or incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nWe may not adequately assess the risks of new business initiatives and subsequent events may arise that alter the risks that were initially considered. Acquisitions, joint ventures and other investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Acquisitions or joint ventures may also reduce our cash available for operation and other uses which could harm our business. For example, the majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs, and there is no guarantee that the JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business. We may not realize the expected benefits from the THATIC JV’s expected future performance, including the receipt of any future milestone payments and any royalties from certain licensed intellectual property. In June 2019, the BIS added certain Chinese entities to the Entity List, including THATIC and the THATIC JV. We are complying with U.S. law pertaining to the Entity List designation.\n\n35\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFurthermore, we invest in both public and private companies to further our strategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. We invest in early-stage companies that may still be in the process of developing a strategic direction and may not yet generate revenue. Many of the equity and debt instruments that we invest in are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return. Our ability to realize a return on our investments in private companies typically depends on the company completing a liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition. Market conditions and events, particularly in periods with economic uncertainty, inflation, volatile public equity markets or unsettled global market conditions, could cause our investments in public companies to expose us to volatility in our results due to changes in market prices and/or impairments. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest in are not successful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment. Our investment portfolio is concentrated in specific sectors. Adverse developments in one or any of these sectors due to regulatory changes, technology disruptions or market downturns could negatively impact the performance of our investment portfolio.\n\nOur ability to complete the acquisition of ZT Systems is subject to closing conditions, including the receipt of consents and approvals from government authorities, which may impose conditions that could adversely affect us or cause the acquisition to not be completed.\n\nOur acquisition of ZT Systems (the Acquisition), which is expected to occur in the first half of 2025, is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of customary conditions as specified in the purchase agreement (the Agreement), including receipt of certain specified required regulatory approvals and the absence of laws or orders restraining the consummation of the Agreement, among others. We cannot assure you that we will receive the necessary regulatory approvals at all or in a timely manner or that closing conditions will be satisfied. Any delay in completing the Acquisition could cause us to not realize, or to be delayed in realizing, some or all of the benefits we expect to achieve from this transaction. Additionally, if the Acquisition is not completed, we may incur significant acquisitions costs that we may be unable to recover, which could negatively affect our business and results of operations. We would be required to pay ZT Systems a termination fee of $300 million if the Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances related to the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals.\n\nWe intend to seek a strategic partner to acquire ZT Systems' manufacturing business, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of this transaction. We may not be able to divest the ZT Systems’ manufacturing business on acceptable terms or at all. Divestitures involve certain risks and uncertainties such as: inability to find potential buyers on favorable terms; failure to receive regulatory or governmental approvals, or delay in receiving such approvals; restrictions due to regulatory or governmental approval, litigation, contractual terms, or other conditions; changes in market conditions or geopolitical conditions affecting the regions or industries in which we or our counterparties operate; distraction of management; failure to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to buyer; continued financial obligations and unanticipated liabilities; and closing delays. Any one of these factors could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional transaction expenses.\n\n36\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAny impairment of our tangible, definite-lived intangible or indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, may adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.\n\nWe account for certain acquisitions, including the Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx), Pensando Systems Inc. (Pensando) and Silo AI acquisitions, using the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, with AMD representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. We record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. In connection with the Xilinx, Pensando and Silo AI acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are tested for impairment at least annually, and all tangible and intangible assets including goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the future, we determine that tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill, are impaired, we would record an impairment charge at that time. Impairment testing of goodwill requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the determination of fair value. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management’s business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achieve internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment. A decrease in the long-term economic outlook and future cash flows of our business could significantly impact asset values and potentially result in the impairment of tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, and may require us to record future impairment charges, which may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\n\nGeneral Risks\n\nOur worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nWe maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, Latin America and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer foundries in the United States, Europe and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at third-party operated manufacturing facilities, in China, Malaysia and Taiwan. Our shipping services are provided by third-party subcontractors. We also have international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of net revenue, were 66% for the year ended December 28, 2024. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. The political, legal and economic risks associated with our worldwide operations include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements and restrictions; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight rates; changes to macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, inflation and recession; transportation restrictions or disruptions; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with U.S. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Recently, the U.S. and other countries and coalitions have issued sanctions and revisions to export control and other regulations against Russia, Belarus, and the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine, due to the conflict in Ukraine. Also, geopolitical changes between China and Taiwan could disrupt the operations of our Taiwan-based third-party wafer foundries, manufacturing facilities and subcontractors, and materially adversely affect delivery of products and our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Moreover, the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas conflicts could escalate and expand, which in turn could have negative impacts on the global economy and financial markets.\n\n37\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIn addition, our worldwide operations (or those of our business partners) could be subject to natural disasters and climate change such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, tropical cyclones, droughts, fires, sea-level rise, extreme heat and volcanic eruptions that disrupt our operations, or those of our manufacturers, vendors or customers. For example, our California operations are located near major earthquake fault lines. In April 2024, Taiwan experienced an earthquake where our third-party wafer foundries are located. We also have operations and employees in regions that have experienced extreme weather such as prolonged heat waves, wildfires and freezing. Extreme weather events and natural disasters can also disrupt the ability of our suppliers to deliver expected manufacturing parts and/or services for periods of time. In addition, certain natural disasters, including drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise and flooding, could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operations of our business or the business of our suppliers or customers. Global climate change also may result in chronic changes that result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, which could disrupt our operations, or the operations of our third parties. There may be conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we, our customers and suppliers operate, including public health issues, epidemics and pandemics, safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. Global health outbreaks, such as COVID-19, have and may continue to adversely affect our employees, disrupt our business operations, as well those of our customers and suppliers. Public health measures by government authorities may cause us to incur additional costs, limit our operations, modify our business practices, diminish employee productivity or disrupt our supply chain, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nThe U.S. has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales and our supply chain. The consequences of armed conflict, political instability or civil or military unrest are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. Terrorist attacks or other hostile acts may negatively affect our operations, or adversely affect demand for our products, and such attacks or related armed conflicts may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore, these attacks or hostile acts may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, which could materially adversely affect us. Any of these events could cause consumer spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the U.S. economy and worldwide financial markets.\n\nAny of the above risks, should they occur, could result in increased costs, shipment delays, general business interruptions, the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, penalties or a loss of export privileges, as well as stringent licensing restrictions that may make our products less attractive to international customers, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe may incur future impairments of our technology license purchases.\n\nWe license certain third-party technologies and tools for the design and production of our products. We report the value of those licenses as other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and we periodically evaluate the carrying value of those licenses based on their future economic benefit to us. Factors such as the life of the assets, changes in competing technologies, and changes to the business strategy may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future technology license impairment charges.\n\nOur inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our business.\n\nMuch of our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering, marketing, sales and executive employees. Competition for highly skilled executives and employees in the technology industry, especially in the areas of AI and machine learning, is intense and our competitors have targeted individuals in our organization that have desired skills and experience. If we are not able to continue to attract, train and retain our leadership team and our qualified employees necessary for our business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be materially adversely affected. We use share-based incentive awards to help attract, retain and motivate our executives and qualified employees. If the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, or if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain and motivate our executives and employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. Also, if the value of our stock awards increases substantially, this could potentially create great personal wealth for our executives and employees and affect our ability to retain our personnel. In addition, any future restructuring plans may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees.\n\n38\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOur stock price is subject to volatility.\n\nOur stock price has experienced price and volume fluctuations and could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. The trading price of our stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial conditions and operating results, changes in financial estimates by us or financial estimates and ratings by securities analysts, changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public, interest rate changes, inflation, news regarding our products or products of our competitors, and broad market and industry fluctuations. Stock price fluctuations could impact the value of our equity compensation, which could affect our ability to recruit and retain employees. In addition, volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities.\n\nWe have an approved stock repurchase program that authorizes repurchases of up to $12 billion of our common stock (Repurchase Program). As of December 28, 2024, $4.7 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under the Repurchase Program. The Repurchase Program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Our stock repurchases could affect the trading price of our stock, the volatility of our stock price, reduce our cash reserves, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which may result in a decrease in our stock price.",

CYBERSECURITY\n\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\n\nWe have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical systems and information.\n\nWe design and assess our program based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) and other industry practices and standards. This does not mean that we meet any particular technical standards, specifications, or requirements, but only that we use the NIST CSF, AI RMF, and other industry practices and standards as guides to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business.\n\nInformation about cybersecurity risks and our risk management processes is collected, analyzed and considered as part of our overall enterprise risk management program.\n\nKey components of our cybersecurity risk management program include:\n\n•\nperiodic risk assessments designed to help identify cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, services, and our broader enterprise IT environment;\n\n•\na security team principally responsible for managing (1) our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (2) our security controls, and (3) our detection and response to cybersecurity incidents;\n\n•\nthe use of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, evaluate, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security controls and processes;\n\n•\nactive testing including penetration tests, attack simulations and tabletop exercises;\n\n•\ncybersecurity awareness training of our employees, incident response personnel and senior management;\n\n•\na cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents; and\n\n•\na third-party cyber risk management process for vendors including, among other things, a security assessment and contracting program for vendors based on their risk profile.\n\n39\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAt this time, we have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. We face certain ongoing risks from cybersecurity threats that, if realized, are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.\nSee “Risk Factors - IT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyberattacks could disrupt operations and compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate or cause significant damage to our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.”\n\nCybersecurity Governance\n\nOur Board considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated to the Audit and Finance Committee (Committee) oversight of cybersecurity and other information technology risks. The Committee oversees management’s implementation of our cybersecurity risk management program.\n\nThe Committee receives quarterly reports from management on our cybersecurity risks. In addition, management updates the Committee, as necessary, regarding any significant cybersecurity incidents.\n\nThe Committee reports to the full Board regarding its activities, including those related to cybersecurity. The full Board also receives a briefing from management on our cyber risk management program at least annually. Board members receive presentations on cybersecurity matters from our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), information security team or external experts as part of the Board’s continuing education on topics that impact public companies. The CISO reports to the Chief Information Officer (CIO).\n\nOur CISO has primary responsibility for our overall cybersecurity risk management program, and directly supervises both our internal cybersecurity personnel and any retained external cybersecurity consultants. Our CISO has over 19 years of experience in cybersecurity including security operations, security architecture, identity and access management, cloud security, vulnerability management, and application/product security, policy, and compliance.\n\nOur CISO is informed about and monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include, among other things, briefings with internal security personnel, threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external consultants engaged by us, and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in our IT environment.",

Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023.\n\nOverview\n\nIn 2024, we delivered strong annual revenue growth with net revenue increasing 14% to $25.8 billion, compared to $22.7 billion in 2023. This growth was driven by the performance of our Data Center and Client segments. Data Center net revenue of $12.6 billion increased by 94% compared to $6.5 billion in 2023, driven by higher sales of our AMD Instinct™ GPUs and AMD EPYC™ CPUs. Client segment net revenue of $7.1 billion in 2024 increased by 52% compared to $4.7 billion in 2023, primarily due to higher sales of our AMD Ryzen™ mobile and desktop processors. The increase in annual net revenue was partially offset by a decrease in net revenue in our Gaming and Embedded segments. Gaming net revenue of $2.6 billion decreased by 58% compared to $6.2 billion in 2023. The decrease in net revenue was primarily due to lower semi-custom product revenue. Embedded net revenue of $3.6 billion decreased by 33% compared to net revenue of $5.3 billion in 2023, as customers normalized their inventory levels.\n\nDuring the year, we successfully launched multiple leadership products and made significant progress executing our AI strategy. One of our priorities in 2024 was to accelerate growth in our Data Center segment. The demand for our Data Center AI accelerator products was very strong led by large hyperscale cloud customers deploying our AMD Instinct MI300X GPU accelerators. During the year, we unveiled an accelerated AMD Instinct accelerator roadmap to deliver an annual cadence of leadership AI solutions. To further expand our high-performance server CPU portfolio, we launched our 5th Gen AMD EPYC™ processors, formerly codenamed “Turin,” built with our latest “Zen 5” core architecture designed to deliver leadership performance and efficiency.\n\nWe took a major step in our AI PC roadmap with the launch of AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series processors that combine leadership compute capabilities based on our “Zen 5” architecture and an industry-leading neural processing unit (NPU) powered by our XDNA 2 architecture for next-generation AI PCs. We added to our Ryzen family of desktop CPUs with the Ryzen 9000 series processors for laptop and desktop PCs that deliver leadership performance in gaming, productivity and content creation. In our Gaming segment, we extended our multigenerational partnership with Sony as they introduced the PlayStation® 5 Pro, which features a new AMD semi-custom SoC designed to deliver increases in graphics and ray tracing performance to enable AI-driven upscaling.\n\nWe expanded our adaptive computing portfolio with differentiated solutions with the launch of the new Versal™ Series Gen 2 devices, including the new Versal AI Edge Series Gen 2 and Versal Prime Series Gen 2 adaptive SoCs, which bring preprocessing, AI inference, and postprocessing together in a single device for end-to-end acceleration of AI-driven embedded systems.\n\nTo execute our AI strategy, we brought together multiple AI teams across AMD to drive development of a comprehensive software ecosystem spanning our full product portfolio. We made several key optimizations and introduced new features in the latest AMD ROCm™ software that increased performance in key generative AI workloads, expanded support and optimization for additional frameworks and libraries, and simplified the overall developer experience. We also made strategic investments to further expand our AI software capabilities with the acquisition of Silo AI Oy (Silo AI), an AI lab based in Finland. The acquisition of Silo AI enables customers to accelerate development and deployment of AI models on AMD hardware. Silo AI has also developed a software stack used to train multiple state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on AMD Instinct accelerators that can accelerate the development of highly-performant AMD training solutions.\n\n43\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe also focused on extending our data center infrastructure capabilities by entering into an agreement in August 2024 to acquire ZT Group Int’l, Inc. (ZT Systems), a provider of AI and general purpose compute infrastructure for hyperscale computing companies. We believe that with the acquisition of ZT Systems, we can accelerate time to market for our leadership AI training and inferencing solutions. The acquisition is expected to close in the first half of fiscal year 2025, subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We intend to seek a strategic partner to acquire ZT Systems' manufacturing business.\n\nGross margin, as a percentage of net revenue, was 49% for 2024, compared to 46% in 2023. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to a favorable shift in revenue mix with higher Data Center and Client revenues, lower Gaming revenue, partially offset by the impact of lower Embedded revenue. Operating income for 2024 was $1.9 billion compared to operating income of $401 million for 2023. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by increased R&D investments. Net income for 2024 was $1.6 billion compared to $854 million in the prior year. The increase in net income was primarily driven by higher revenue.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 28, 2024 were $5.1 billion, compared to $5.8 billion at the end of 2023. Our aggregate principal amount of total debt as of December 28, 2024 was $1.8 billion, compared to $2.5 billion\nas of December 30, 2023. We repaid our 2.95% Senior Notes due 2024 with a principal amount of $750 million in June 2024.\n\nDuring the twelve months ended December 28, 2024, we returned a total of $862 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 5.9 million shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program. As of December 28, 2024, $4.7 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this program. The stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\n\nWe intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.\n\nManagement believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\n\nRevenue Allowances.\nRevenue contracts with our customers include variable amounts which we evaluate under ASC 606-10-32-8 through 14 in order to determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled and which we recognize as revenue. We determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer after adjustments to the contract price for rights of return and rebates to our original equipment manufacturers (OEM) customers and rights of return, rebates and price protection on unsold merchandise to our distributor customers.\n\nWe base our determination of necessary adjustments to the contract price by reference to actual historical activity and experience, including actual historical returns, rebates and credits issued to OEM and distributor customers adjusted, as applicable, to include adjustments, if any, for known events or current economic conditions, or both.\n\nOur estimates of necessary adjustments for distributor price incentives and price protection on unsold products held by distributors are based on actual historical incentives provided to distributor customers and known future price movements based on our internal and external market data analysis.\n\n44\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOur estimates of necessary adjustments for OEM price incentives utilize, in addition to known pricing agreements, actual historical rebate attainment rates and estimates of future OEM rebate program attainment based on internal and external market data analysis.\n\nWe offer incentive programs through cooperative advertising and marketing promotions. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, we recognize a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, we recognize such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where we reimburse a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition.\n\nWe also provide limited product return rights to certain OEMs and to most distribution customers. These return rights are generally limited to a contractual percentage of the customer’s prior quarter shipments, although, from time to time we may approve additional product returns beyond the contractual arrangements based on the applicable facts and circumstances. In order to estimate adjustments to revenue to account for these returns, including product restocking rights provided to distributor and OEM customers, we utilize relevant, trended actual historical product return rate information gathered, adjusted for actual known information or events, as applicable.\n\nOverall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration under our contracts with OEM and distributor customers, based on our assumptions and include adjustments, if any, for known events, have been materially consistent with actual results; however, these estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.\n\nInventory Valuation.\nWe value inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Material assumptions we use to estimate necessary inventory carrying value adjustments can be unique to each product and are based on specific facts and circumstances. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for products, we consider assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for our products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, we consider assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. If in any period we anticipate a change in assumptions such as future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales, resulting in a negative impact to our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that had been written down to a level below the ultimate realized selling price in a previous period, related revenue would be recorded with a lower or no offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Overall, our estimates of inventory carrying value adjustments have been materially consistent with actual results.\n\nGoodwill.\nGoodwill is the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations. Our reporting units are at the operating segment level. Our goodwill is contained within four reporting units: Data Center, Client, Gaming and Embedded.\n\nWe perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment, which occurs when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of our reporting units to determine if the fair values of those units exceed their carrying values and an impairment to goodwill is required when a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. We typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists to help in determining the fair value of our reporting units. Changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of our reporting units’ goodwill. Based on our annual qualitative impairment test, we concluded it is not more likely than not that the carrying value of each reporting unit exceeded its fair value.\n\n45\n\nTable of Contents\n\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets.\nLong-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. When indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, we estimate future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the related asset groups. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on appraisals.\n\nIncome Taxes\n. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.\n\nWe regularly assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. Unless recovery is considered more-likely-than-not (a probability level of more than 50%), we will record a charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods. When considering all available evidence, if we determine it is more-likely-than-not we will realize our deferred tax assets, we will reverse some or all of the existing valuation allowance, which would result in a credit to income tax expense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal.\n\nIn determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance, we consider the four sources of jurisdictional taxable income: (i) carryback of net operating losses to prior years; (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (iii) viable and prudent tax planning strategies; and (iv) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.\n\nThe federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations, under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowances are maintained due to a lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.\n\nIn addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves addressing uncertainties in the application of complex, multi-jurisdictional tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities.\n\nResults of Operations\n\nAdditional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 4\n–\nSegment Reporting of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).\n\nOur operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends.\n\n46\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2024 and 2023:\n\nYear Ended\nDecember 28,\n2024\nDecember 30,\n2023\n(In millions)\nNet revenue:\nData Center\n$\n12,579\n$\n6,496\nClient\n7,054\n4,651\nGaming\n2,595\n6,212\nEmbedded\n3,557\n5,321\nTotal net revenue\n$\n25,785\n$\n22,680\nOperating income (loss):\nData Center\n$\n3,482\n$\n1,267\nClient\n897\n(46)\nGaming\n290\n971\nEmbedded\n1,421\n2,628\nAll Other\n(4,190)\n(4,419)\nTotal operating income\n$\n1,900\n$\n401\n\nData Center\n\nData Center net revenue of $12.6 billion in 2024 increased by 94%, compared to net revenue of $6.5 billion in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher sales of AMD Instinct GPUs and AMD EPYC CPUs.\n\nData Center operating income was $3.5 billion in 2024, compared to operating income of $1.3 billion in 2023. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment.\n\nClient\n\nClient net revenue of $7.1 billion in 2024 increased by 52%, compared to net revenue of $4.7 billion in 2023, primarily due to a 34% increase in unit shipments and a 13% increase in average selling price driven by strong demand for AMD mobile and desktop Ryzen processors.\n\nClient operating income was $897 million in 2024, compared to operating loss of $46 million in 2023. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses.\n\nGaming\n\nGaming net revenue of $2.6 billion in 2024 decreased by 58%, compared to net revenue of $6.2 billion in 2023. The decrease in net revenue was primarily due to lower semi-custom product revenue.\n\nGaming operating income was $290 million in 2024, compared to operating income of $971 million in 2023. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by lower revenue.\n\nEmbedded\n\nEmbedded net revenue of $3.6 billion in 2024\ndecreased\nby 33%, compared to net revenue of $5.3 billion in 2023. The decrease in net revenue was primarily due to lower demand as customers continued to normalize their inventory levels.\n\nEmbedded operating income was $1.4 billion in 2024, compared to operating income of $2.6 billion in 2023. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by lower revenue.\n\nAll Other\n\nAll Other operating loss of $4.2 billion in 2024 primarily consisted of $2.4 billion of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and $1.4 billion of stock-based compensation expense. All Other operating loss of $4.4 billion in 2023 primarily consisted of $2.8 billion of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and $1.4 billion of stock-based compensation expense.\n\n47\n\nTable of Contents\n\nComparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Licensing Gain, Interest Expense, Other Income (expense) and Income Taxes\n\nThe following is a summary of certain Consolidated Statement of Operations data for 2024 and 2023:\n\nDecember 28, 2024\nDecember 30, 2023\n(In millions, except for percentages)\nNet revenue\n$\n25,785\n$\n22,680\nCost of sales\n12,114\n11,278\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangibles\n946\n942\nGross profit\n12,725\n10,460\nGross margin\n49\n%\n46\n%\nResearch and development\n6,456\n5,872\nMarketing, general and administrative\n2,783\n2,352\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangibles\n1,448\n1,869\nRestructuring charges\n186\n—\nLicensing gain\n(48)\n(34)\nInterest expense\n(92)\n(106)\nOther income (expense), net\n181\n197\nIncome tax provision (benefit)\n381\n(346)\n\nGross Margin\n\nGross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 49% in 2024 compared to 46% in 2023. The increase in gross margin was due to a favorable shift in revenue mix of higher Data Center and Client revenues, lower Gaming revenue, partially offset by the impact of lower Embedded revenue.\n\nExpenses\n\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\nResearch and development expenses of $6.5 billion in 2024 increased by $584 million, or 10%, compared to $5.9 billion in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher employee-related costs due to an increase in headcount in support of our AI strategy.\n\nMarketing, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nMarketing, general and administrative expenses of $2.8 billion in 2024 increased by $431 million, or 18%, compared to $2.4 billion in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in go-to-market activities to support our revenue growth.\n\nAmortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles\n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $2.4 billion for 2024 decreased by $417 million, or 15%, compared to $2.8 billion in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to certain acquisition-related intangibles being fully amortized in the prior fiscal year.\n\nRestructuring Charges\n\nWe recognized $\n186\nmillion of restructuring charges in 2024 due to the implementation of a restructuring plan (the 2024 Restructuring Plan). The 2024 Restructuring Plan was focused on driving efficiencies across the business and aligning resources with our largest growth opportunities in the AI and enterprise markets.\n\nLicensing Gain\n\nWe hold equity interests in two joint ventures (collectively, the THATIC JV) with Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd. (THATIC), a third-party Chinese entity. We recognized $48 million and $34 million of licensing gain from royalty income associated with the licensed IP to the THATIC JV, in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n48\n\nTable of Contents\n\nInterest Expense\n\nInterest expense of $92 million in 2024 decreased by $14 million compared to $106 million in 2023, primarily due to repayment of the 2.95% Senior Notes due in June 2024.\n\nOther Income (expense), net\n\nOther income (expense), net is primarily comprised of interest income from short-term investments, changes in valuation of equity investments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses.\n\nOther income (expense), net was $181 million in 2024 compared to $197 million of Other income, net in 2023. The change was primarily due to a decrease in interest income from lower balances held in short-term investments compared to the prior year.\n\nIncome Tax Provision (Benefit)\n\nWe recorded an income tax provision of $381 million in 2024 and an income tax benefit of $346 million in 2023, representing effective tax rates of 19% and (68%), respectively. The increase in income tax provision in 2024 was primarily due to higher pre-tax income and a $373 million tax effect from an intercompany integration transaction.\n\nGlobal Minimum Tax\n\nThe OECD is continuing discussions surrounding fundamental changes in allocation of profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business, as well as the implementation of a global minimum tax (namely the “Pillar One” and “Pillar Two” proposals). The Council of the European Union has adopted the global corporate 15% minimum tax as provided for in Pillar Two and has directed EU member states to implement legislation enacting Pillar Two. Many countries, including non-EU member states, have implemented laws based on Pillar Two proposals, with effective dates that started in 2024. Although many countries have already introduced Pillar Two legislation applicable to us effective in 2024, certain jurisdictions in which we operate have not adopted corresponding legislation to date. For 2024, the impact to us associated with Pillar Two was immaterial. We continue to evaluate the impact of proposed and enacted legislative changes to our effective tax rate and cash flows as new guidance becomes available.\n\nInternational Sales\n\nInternational sales as a percentage of net revenue were\n66%\nin 2024 and 65% in 2023. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.\n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nAs of December 28, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $5.1 billion compared to $5.8 billion as of December 30, 2023. The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held domestically was 90% as of December 28, 2024, and 77% as of December 30, 2023.\n\nOur operating, investing and financing cash flow activities for 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nDecember 28, 2024\nDecember 30, 2023\n(In millions)\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n3,041\n$\n1,667\nInvesting activities\n(1,101)\n(1,423)\nFinancing activities\n(2,062)\n(1,146)\nNet decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n(122)\n$\n(902)\n\nWe have $3.0 billion available under an unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on April 29, 2027. No funds were drawn from this credit facility during the year ended December 28, 2024.\n\n49\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe also have a commercial paper program to issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum principal amount outstanding, at any time, of $3.0 billion, with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. We did not issue any commercial paper during the year ended December 28, 2024.\n\nOur aggregate principal debt obligations were $1.8 billion as of December 28, 2024. Our 2.95% Notes with a principal amount of $750 million were repaid in June 2024 and our remaining debt will mature starting in 2030.\n\nAs of December 28, 2024, we had unconditional purchase commitments of approximately $5.0 billion, of which $4.5 billion are in fiscal year 2025. Our contractual obligations and purchase commitments relate primarily to our obligations to purchase wafers and substrates from third parties and future payments related to certain software and technology licenses and IP licenses. On an ongoing basis, we work with our suppliers on the timing of payments and deliveries of purchase commitments, taking into account business conditions. See Note 17 – Commitments and Guarantees.\n\nOn August 17, 2024, we agreed to acquire ZT Systems. Upon closing of the acquisition, we will pay approximately $3.4 billion in cash and 8,335,852 shares of AMD common stock and to the extent certain conditions are met, we will pay an additional $300 million of cash and up to 740,964 shares of AMD common stock. The acquisition is expected to close in the first half of fiscal year 2025, subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We intend to seek a strategic partner to acquire ZT Systems' manufacturing business.\n\nWe believe our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows from operations along with our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, purchase commitments, and acquisitions over the next 12 months and beyond. We believe we will be able to access the capital markets should we require additional funds. However, we cannot assure that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all.\n\nOperating Activities\n\nOur working capital cash inflows and outflows from operations consist primarily of cash collections from our customers, payments for inventory purchases and payments for employee-related expenditures.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $3 billion in 2024, primarily due to our net income of $1.6 billion in 2024, adjusted for non-cash adjustments of $3.5 billion and net cash outflows of $2.1 billion from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $1.9 billion increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by higher revenue in the last month of 2024 compared to the last month of 2023, and a $1.5 billion increase in inventories driven primarily by a build of inventory to support the ramp of new products in advanced process nodes.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion in 2023, primarily due to our net income of $854 million in 2023, adjusted for non-cash adjustments of $3.9 billion and net cash outflows of $3 billion from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $1.3 billion increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by higher revenue in the last month of 2023 compared to the last month of 2022, and a $580 million increase in inventories driven primarily by a build of inventory to support the ramp of new products in advanced process nodes.\n\nInvesting Activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.1 billion in 2024, which primarily consisted of cash used for purchases of short-term investments of $1.5 billion, $636 million for purchases of property and equipment, and cash used in acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $548 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities of short-term investments of $1.4 billion and sale of short-term investments of $616 million.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.4 billion in 2023, which primarily consisted of cash used for purchases of short-term investments of $3.7 billion, $546 million for purchases of property and equipment, and cash used in acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $131 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities of short-term investments of $2.7 billion and the sale of short-term investments of $300 million.\n\n50\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFinancing Activities\n\nNet cash used in financing activities was $2.1 billion in 2024, which primarily consisted of common stock repurchases of $862 million under the Repurchase Program, repurchases to cover tax withholding on employee equity plans of $728 million, and repayment of the 2.95% Notes of $750 million\n,\npartially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee equity plans of $279 million.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.1 billion in 2023, which primarily consisted of common stock repurchases of $985 million under the Repurchase Program and repurchases to cover tax withholding on employee equity plans of $427 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee equity plans of $268 million.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nAs of December 28, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.\n\n51\n\nTable of Contents",

      "title": "QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK",
      "content": "Interest Rate Risk.\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 28, 2024, our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income instruments, time deposits and commercial paper. Our primary aim with our investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs. In accordance with our investment policy, we place investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer based upon the issuer's credit rating. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. A hypothetical 50 basis-point (half percentage point) increase or decrease in interest rates compared to rates on December 28, 2024 would have affected the fair value of our cash equivalent and investment portfolio by approximately $6 million.\n\nAs of December 28, 2024, all of our outstanding long-term debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal.\n\nWe will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk.\n\nDefault Risk.\nWe mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.\n\nWe actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities which we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 28, 2024, all of our investments in debt securities were A-rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment-related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control.\n\nForeign Exchange Risk.\nAs a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.\n\nWe maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nThe following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023.

to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nNOTE 1 –\nThe Company\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. is a global semiconductor company. References herein to AMD or the Company mean Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. AMD’s products include Artificial Intelligence (AI) Accelerators, x86 microprocessors (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), as standalone devices or as incorporated into accelerated processing units (APUs), chipsets, data center and professional GPUs, embedded processors, semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products, microprocessor and SoC development services and technology, data processing units (DPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), System on Modules (SOMs), Smart Network Interface Cards (SmartNICs), and Adaptive SoC products. From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its intellectual property (IP) portfolio.\n\nNOTE 2 –\nBasis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\n\nFiscal Year\n. The Company uses a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 ended on December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Fiscal years 2024 and 2023 each consisted of 52 weeks, while fiscal year 2022 consisted of 53 weeks.\nPrinciples of Consolidation.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nReclassification and Change in Presentation.\nUnbilled receivables of $\n1.1\nbillion as of December 30, 2023 were reclassified from within Accounts receivable, net to within Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and in the Statements of Cash Flows to conform to current period presentation.\nUse of Estimates.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not limited to, revenue allowances, inventory valuation, valuation of goodwill and long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value-added, and other taxes collected concurrently with the provision of goods or services are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in cost of sales. Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is derived from product sales.\nCustomers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company’s standard contractual terms, which are typically net\n30\nto\n60\ndays. The Company has determined that it does not have significant financing components in its contracts with customers.\nNon-custom products\nThe Company transfers control and recognizes revenue when non-custom products are shipped to customers, which includes original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and distributors, in accordance with the shipping terms of the sale. Certain OEMs may be entitled to rights of return and rebates under OEM agreements. The Company also sells to distributors under terms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration under OEM and distributor arrangements and, accordingly, records a provision for product returns, allowances for price protection and rebates based on actual historical experience and any known events.\n\n59\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Company offers incentive programs to certain customers, including cooperative advertising, marketing promotions, volume-based incentives and special pricing arrangements. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, the Company recognizes a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, the Company recognizes such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition.\nConstraints of variable consideration have not been material.\nCustom products\nCustom products, which are primarily associated with the Company’s Gaming segment, are sold under non-cancellable purchases orders, for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, and which have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, are recognized as revenue, over the time of production of the products by the Company. The Company utilizes a cost-based input method, calculated as cost incurred plus estimated margin, to determine the amount of revenue to recognize for in-process or completed customer orders at a reporting date. The Company believes that a cost-based input method is the most appropriate manner to measure how the Company satisfies its performance obligations to customers because the effort and costs incurred best depict the Company’s satisfaction of its performance obligation.\nSales of custom products are not subject to a right of return and arrangements generally involve a single performance obligation. Generally, there are no variable consideration estimates associated with custom products.\nDevelopment and intellectual property licensing agreements\nFrom time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that combine the provision of development services and a license to the right to use the Company’s IP. These arrangements are deemed to be single or multiple performance obligations based upon the nature of the arrangements. Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control, over time or at a point in time, depending on the nature of the arrangements. The Company evaluates whether the licensing component is distinct. A licensing component is distinct if it is both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the arrangement. If the license is not distinct, it is combined with the development services as a single performance obligation and recognized over time. If the license is distinct, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\nFrom time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that solely involve the sale or licensing of its patents or IP. Generally, there are no performance obligations beyond transferring the designated license to the Company’s patents or IP. Accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\nThere are no variable consideration estimates associated with either combined development and IP arrangements or for standalone arrangements involving either the sale or licensing of IP.\nInventories\nThe Company values inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of\nactual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for its products, the Company considers assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for its products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, the Company considers assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. The Company fully reserves for inventories and non-cancellable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. The Company performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances and non-cancellable purchase orders to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory carrying value adjustments may be required\n.\n\n60\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company is required to use the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The acquisition method of accounting requires the Company to allocate the purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquiree based on their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future revenue growth rates and margins, future changes in technology, time to recreate customer relationships, useful lives, and discount rates. Fair value estimates are based on the assumptions that management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made.\nGoodwill\nThe Company performs its goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment.\nThe Company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the Company does not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test.\nIf the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or elects to bypass the qualitative test, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If a reporting unit’s fair value is determined to be less than its carrying value, a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets\nLong-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows.\nWhen indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, the Company estimates future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the related asset groups. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows.\nWhen assets are removed from operations and held for sale, the Company estimates impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair value. Market conditions are among the factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate impairment recognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale.\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are primarily comprised of trade receivables presented net of rebates, price protection and an allowance for credit loss. The Company manages its exposure to customer credit risk through credit limits, credit lines, ongoing monitoring procedures and credit approvals. While the Company maintains an allowance for customer credit losses, its accounts receivable write-offs have historically not been significant.\n\n61\n\nTable of Contents\n\nUnbilled Receivables\nUnbilled receivables are recorded within Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unbilled receivables primarily represent work completed on development services and on custom products under non-cancellable purchase orders that have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, recognized as revenue but not yet invoiced to customers.\nInvestments\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities.\nInvestments in marketable debt securities are available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and are classified within current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value, with the change in unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income until realized. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable. Securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of the excess, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Expected credit losses on securities are recognized in other income (expense) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and any remaining unrealized losses, net of tax, are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), in Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. The Company uses the first-in, first-out method as basis of the cost of securities sold.\nStrategic Non-marketable Equity Securities.\nThe Company’s investments in non-marketable securities of privately-held companies are held for long-term strategic purposes and are accounted for under the measurement alternative, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes and are periodically assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a decline in value may have occurred. The Company's periodic assessment of impairment is made by considering available evidence, including the investee’s general market and industry conditions and product development status. The Company also assesses the investee’s ability to meet business milestones, its financial condition, and near-term prospects, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash, the investee’s need for possible additional funding at a lower valuation and any bona fide offer to purchase the investee.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company’s financial instruments are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for non-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies, which are generally accounted for under the measurement alternative.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities. The guidance for fair value measurements requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:\nLevel 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3 — Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of two to 15 years for equipment, 34 to 44 years for buildings, and leasehold improvements are measured by the shorter of the remaining terms of the leases or the estimated useful economic lives of the improvements.\n\n62\n\nTable of Contents\n\nLeases\nOperating and finance leases are recorded as right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the implicit interest rate if readily determinable. When the implicit interest rate is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, which is based on its collateralized borrowing capabilities over a similar term of the lease payments. When using the incremental borrowing rate, the Company utilizes the consolidated group incremental borrowing rate. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the accounting policy to not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term (12 months or less) leases for any class of underlying asset. Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s finance leases are immaterial.\nForeign Currency Translation/Transactions\nThe functional currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars have been remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions have been remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those cost of sales and expense transactions related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts which have been remeasured at historical exchange rates. The gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings.\nMarketing and Advertising Expenses\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. In addition, the Company’s marketing and advertising expenses include certain cooperative advertising funding obligations under customer incentive programs, which costs are recorded upon agreement with customers and vendor partners. Cooperative advertising expenses are recorded as marketing, general and administrative expense to the extent the cash paid does not exceed the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Total marketing and advertising expenses for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were approximately $\n1.2\nbillion, $\n695\nmillion and $\n683\nmillion, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company estimates stock-based compensation cost for stock options at the grant date based on the option’s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes model. For time-based restricted stock units (RSUs), fair value is based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of RSUs that involve a market condition using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of stock to be issued under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase plan (ESPP) using the Black-Scholes model. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award using the straight-line method, except for the compensation expense related to RSUs with performance or market conditions (PRSUs), which are recognized ratably for each vesting tranche from the service inception date to the end of the requisite service period. Forfeiture rates are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nContingencies\nFrom time to time the Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The Company is also subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which it conducts business. In addition, the Company is a party to environmental matters including local, regional, state and federal government clean-up activities at or near locations where the Company currently or has in the past conducted business. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of reasonably possible losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies that would be charged to earnings, if any, includes assessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses. The required reserves, if any, may change due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances such as a change in settlement strategy.\n\n63\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company computes the provision for income taxes using the liability method and recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using tax rates applicable to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled and provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will be realized. The assessment requires significant judgment and is performed in each of the applicable taxing jurisdictions. In addition, the Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that they will be sustained, based on the technical merits of the positions, on examination by the jurisdictional tax authority. Interest and penalties related to income taxes are recorded within the Income tax provision (benefit) line in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company is subject to the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) tax in the U.S. and recognizes deferred taxes for temporary basis differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI tax in future years.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standard Updates Adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280) Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures to enhance disclosures about significant segment expenses. This ASU is effective for the Company’s fiscal year 2024 and interim periods in fiscal year 2025. The Company adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2024. See Note 4 - Segment Reporting for further information.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standard Updates Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 Income Taxes (Topic 740) Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures that requires disclosure of disaggregated income taxes paid, prescribes standard categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation, and modifies other income tax-related disclosures. This ASU is effective for the Company’s fiscal year 2025. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating income tax disclosures related to its annual report for fiscal year 2025.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. The new guidance is intended to provide investors enhanced disclosures and requires public companies to disaggregate key expense types. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The disclosure updates are required to be applied prospectively with the option for retrospective application. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAlthough there are several other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, the Company does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements had or will have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements\n.\n\nNOTE 3 –\nSupplemental Financial Statement Information\n\nInventories\nDecember 28,\n2024\nDecember 30,\n2023\n(In millions)\nRaw materials\n$\n351\n$\n279\nWork in process\n4,289\n3,260\nFinished goods\n1,094\n812\nTotal inventories\n$\n5,734\n$\n4,351\n\n64\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\nDecember 28,\n2024\nDecember 30,\n2023\n(In millions)\nUnbilled receivables\n$\n628\n$\n1,053\nOther\n1,250\n1,259\nTotal prepaid expenses and other current assets\n$\n1,878\n$\n2,312\nProperty and Equipment, net\nDecember 28,\n2024\nDecember 30,\n2023\n(In millions)\nLand, building and leasehold improvements\n$\n853\n$\n821\nEquipment\n2,798\n2,346\nConstruction in progress\n324\n209\nProperty and equipment, gross\n3,975\n3,376\nAccumulated depreciation\n(\n2,173\n)\n(\n1,787\n)\nTotal property and equipment, net\n$\n1,802\n$\n1,589\nDepreciation expense for 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n454\nmillion, $\n441\nmillion and $\n439\nmillion, respectively.\nAccrued Liabilities\nDecember 28,\n2024\nDecember 30,\n2023\n(In millions)\nAccrued marketing programs\n$\n1,063\n$\n827\nAccrued compensation and benefits\n1,174\n884\nCustomer-related liabilities\n1,349\n788\nOther accrued and current liabilities\n674\n583\nTotal accrued liabilities\n$\n4,260\n$\n3,082\nRevenue\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) include amounts received from customers and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods for development services, IP licensing and product revenue.

These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the reportable segments based on management’s judgment. The CODM is regularly provided segment operating income to assess relative segment performance.\n\n65\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Company’s four reportable segments are:\n•\nthe Data Center segment, which primarily includes Artificial Intelligence (AI) accelerators, server microprocessors (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), accelerated processing units (APUs), data processing units (DPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Smart Network Interface Cards (SmartNICs) and Adaptive System-on-Chip (SoC) products for data centers;\n•\nthe Client segment, which primarily includes CPUs, APUs, and chipsets for desktops and notebooks;\n•\nthe Gaming segment, which primarily includes discrete GPUs, and semi-custom SoC products and development services; and\n•\nthe Embedded segment, which primarily includes embedded CPUs, GPUs, APUs, FPGAs, System on Modules (SOMs), and Adaptive SoC products.\nFrom time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its IP portfolio.\nIn addition to these reportable segments, the Company has an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the reportable segments because the CODM does not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the reportable segments. This category primarily includes amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, employee stock-based compensation, acquisition-related and other costs, restructuring charges and licensing gain. Acquisition-related and other costs primarily include transaction costs, purchase price fair value adjustments for inventory, certain compensation charges, contract termination costs and workforce rebalancing charges.\n\n66\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nYear Ended\nDecember 28,\n2024\nDecember 30,\n2023\nDecember 31,\n2022\n(In millions)\nNet revenue:\nData Center\n$\n12,579\n$\n6,496\n$\n6,043\nClient\n7,054\n4,651\n6,201\nGaming\n2,595\n6,212\n6,805\nEmbedded\n3,557\n5,321\n4,552\nTotal net revenue\n$\n25,785\n$\n22,680\n$\n23,601\nCost of sales and operating expenses:\nData Center\n$\n9,097\n$\n5,229\n$\n4,195\nClient\n6,157\n4,697\n5,011\nGaming\n2,305\n5,241\n5,852\nEmbedded\n2,136\n2,693\n2,300\nAll Other\n4,190\n4,419\n4,979\nTotal cost of sales and operating expenses\n$\n23,885\n$\n22,279\n$\n22,337\nOperating income (loss):\nData Center\n$\n3,482\n$\n1,267\n$\n1,848\nClient\n897\n(\n46\n)\n1,190\nGaming\n290\n971\n953\nEmbedded\n1,421\n2,628\n2,252\nAll Other\n(\n4,190\n)\n(\n4,419\n)\n(\n4,979\n)\nTotal operating income\n$\n1,900\n$\n401\n$\n1,264\nSegment cost of sales and operating expenses primarily include material, external manufacturing, labor and marketing and advertising costs, and exclude expenses and credits that are recorded within the All Other category.\nThe following table provides items included in All Other category:\nYear Ended\nDecember 28,\n2024\nDecember 30,\n2023\nDecember 31,\n2022\n(In millions)\nOperating loss:\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangibles\n$\n2,394\n$\n2,811\n$\n3,548\nStock-based compensation expense\n1,407\n1,384\n1,081\nAcquisition-related and other costs\n186\n258\n452\nRestructuring charges\n186\n—\n—\nInventory loss at contract manufacturer\n65\n—\n—\nLicensing gain\n(\n48\n)\n(\n34\n)\n(\n102\n)\nTotal operating loss\n$\n4,190\n$\n4,419\n$\n4,979\nThe Company does not discretely allocate assets to its operating segments, nor does management evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information.\n\n67\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe following table summarizes sales to external customers by geographic regions based on billing location of the customer:\nYear Ended\nDecember 28,\n2024\nDecember 30,\n2023\nDecember 31,\n2022\n(In millions)\nUnited States\n8,693\n7,837\n8,049\nChina (including Hong Kong)\n6,231\n3,417\n5,207\nSingapore\n3,614\n2,231\n1,380\nTaiwan\n3,301\n1,841\n2,369\nJapan\n1,767\n4,629\n4,177\nEurope\n1,625\n2,030\n1,773\nOther regions\n554\n695\n646\nTotal sales to external customers\n$\n25,785\n$\n22,680\n$\n23,601\nThe following table summarizes sales to a major customer that accounted for at least 10% of the Company’s consolidated net revenue for the respective years:\nYear Ended\nSegment\nDecember 28,\n2024\nDecember 30,\n2023\nDecember 31,\n2022\nCustomer A\nGaming\n*\n18\n%\n16\n%\n*\nLess than 10%\nThe following table summarizes Property and equipment, net by geographic areas:\nDecember 28,\n2024\nDecember 30,\n2023\n(In millions)\nUnited States\n$\n1,312\n$\n1,143\nSingapore\n140\n144\nCanada\n104\n84\nIndia\n100\n86\nIreland\n46\n46\nChina (including Hong Kong)\n38\n42\nOther countries\n62\n44\nTotal property and equipment, net\n$\n1,802\n$\n1,589\n\nNOTE 5 –\nBusiness Combinations\n\nFiscal Year 2024 Acquisitions\nSilo AI Acquisition\nOn August 9, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Silo AI Oy (Silo AI), an AI lab based in Finland in an all-cash transaction of $665 million.

Additionally, an event of default may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the\n3.924\n% Notes and\n4.393\n% Notes.\nFuture Payments on Total Debt\nAs of December 28, 2024, the Company’s future debt payment obligations were as follows:\nTerm Debt\n(Principal only)\nYear\n(In millions)\n2025 - 2029\n—\n2030 and thereafter\n1,750\nTotal\n$\n1,750\nRevolving Credit Facility\nThe Company has $\n3\nbillion available under a revolving credit agreement, as amended, that expires on April 29, 2027 (Revolving Credit Agreement). As of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the Company had\nno\noutstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement. Revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement can be either Secure Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Loans or Base Rate Loans (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) at the Company's option. Each SOFR Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the applicable SOFR plus a margin between 0.575% and 1.20%. Each Base Rate Loan will bear interest equal to the Base Rate plus a margin between 0.000% and 0.20%. The Revolving Credit Agreement also contains a sustainability-linked pricing component which provides for interest rate and facility fee reductions or increases based on the Company meeting or missing targets related to environmental sustainability, specifically greenhouse gas emissions. The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries. As of December 28, 2024, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.\nCommercial Paper\n\nOn November 3, 2022, the Company established a commercial paper program, under which the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of $\n3\nbillion with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue.

These contracts generally mature within 24 months and are designated as accounting hedges. As of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the notional value of the Company’s outstanding foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was $\n2.2\nbillion and $\n2.4\nbillion, respectively. The fair value of these contracts as of December 28, 2024 is recorded within Prepaid expenses and other current assets, Accrued liabilities and Other long-term liabilities of $\n6\nmillion, $\n60\nmillion and $\n11\nmillion, respectively. As of December 30, 2023, the fair value of these contracts was recorded within Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Accrued liabilities of $\n24\nmillion and $\n18\nmillion, respectively.\nForeign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Accounting Hedges\nThe Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on certain receivables or payables denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. These forward contracts generally mature within 3 months and are not designated as accounting hedges. As of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the notional value of these outstanding contracts was $\n642\nmillion and $\n568\nmillion, respectively. The fair value of these contracts was not material as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023.\nThe cash flows associated with derivative instruments as cash flow hedging instruments are classified in the same category within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as the cash flows of the related items.\n\n75\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNOTE 10 –\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of investments in time deposits, available-for-sale debt securities, equity investments and trade receivables.\nThe Company places its investments with high credit quality financial institutions. At the time an investment is made, investments in commercial paper of industrial firms and financial institutions are rated A1, P1, F1 or better. The Company invests in bonds that are rated A, A2 or better and repurchase agreements, each of which have securities of the type and quality listed above as collateral.\nThe Company believes that concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up the Company’s customer base, thus diluting the trade credit risk. One customer accounted for approximately\n24\n% and another customer accounted for\n16\n% of the total consolidated accounts receivable balance as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively. However, the Company does not believe the receivable balance from these customers represents a significant credit risk based on past collection experience and review of their current credit quality.\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit losses from nonperformance by counterparties on foreign currency hedge contracts. These counterparties are large global institutions, and to date, no such counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations to the Company.\n\nNOTE 11 –\nEarnings Per Share\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding.\nDiluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive shares are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the Company’s stock options, RSUs (including PRSUs), common stock to be issued under the ESPP and warrants.\nThe following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted earnings per share:\nYear Ended\nDecember 28, 2024\nDecember 30, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nNumerator\nNet income for basic earnings per share\n$\n1,641\n$\n854\n$\n1,320\nDenominator\nBasic weighted-average shares\n1,620\n1,614\n1,561\nEffect of potentially dilutive shares from employee equity plans\n17\n11\n10\nDiluted weighted-average shares\n1,637\n1,625\n1,571\nEarnings per share:\nBasic\n$\n1.01\n$\n0.53\n$\n0.85\nDiluted\n$\n1.00\n$\n0.53\n$\n0.84\nPotential shares from employee equity plans totaling\n1\nmillion,\n6\nmillion and\n16\nmillion weighted-average shares for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were not included in the earnings per share calculation because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.\n\n76\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNOTE 12 –\nCommon Stock and Stock-Based Compensation\n\nCommon Stock\nShares of common stock outstanding were as follows:\nYear Ended\nDecember 28,\n2024\nDecember 30,\n2023\nDecember 31,\n2022\n(In millions)\nBalance, beginning of period\n1,616\n1,612\n1,207\nCommon stock issued in the acquisition of Xilinx\n—\n—\n429\nCommon stock issued under employee equity plans\n17\n17\n17\nRepurchases of common stock\n(\n6\n)\n(\n10\n)\n(\n36\n)\nCommon stock repurchases for tax withholding on equity awards\n(\n5\n)\n(\n4\n)\n(\n5\n)\nIssuance of common stock upon warrant exercise\n—\n1\n—\nBalance, end of period\n1,622\n1,616\n1,612\nStock Repurchase Program\nThe Company has an approved stock repurchase program authorizing repurchases of up to $\n12\nbillion of the Company’s common stock (Repurchase Program). During the year ended December 28, 2024, the Company repurchased\n5.9\nmillion shares of its common stock under the Repurchase Program for $\n862\nmillion. As of December 28, 2024, $\n4.7\nbillion remained available for future stock repurchases under this program. This Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company’s employee equity programs are intended to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified employees. On May 18, 2023, the Company’s stockholders approved the AMD 2023 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2023 Plan), which supersedes the AMD 2004 Equity Incentive Plan and the Xilinx, Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the Prior Plans). Outstanding awards granted under the Prior Plans will continue to be governed by the terms of the Prior Plans but no awards may be made under the Prior Plans on or after May 18, 2023. Under the 2023 Plan,\n87,645,874\nshares of the Company’s common stock are reserved and available for delivery pursuant to awards granted under the 2023 Plan. Generally, stock options granted under the 2023 Plan vest and become exercisable over a\nfour-year\nperiod from the date of grant and expire within\nseven years\nafter the grant date. Unvested shares from the 2023 Plan that are reacquired by the Company from forfeited outstanding equity awards become available for grant and may be reissued as new awards. Under the 2023 Plan, the Company can grant (i) stock options, and (ii) RSUs, including time-based RSUs and PRSUs.\nStock Options.\nUnder the 2023 Plan, nonstatutory and incentive stock options may be granted. The exercise price of the shares subject to each nonstatutory stock option and incentive stock option cannot be less than\n100\n% of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. The exercise price of each option granted under the 2023 Plan must be paid in full at the time of the exercise.\nTime-based RSUs.\nTime-based RSUs are awards that can be granted to any employee, director or consultant and that obligate the Company to issue a specific number of shares of the Company’s common stock in the future if the vesting terms and conditions are satisfied.\nPRSUs.\nPRSUs can be granted to certain of the Company’s senior executives. The performance metrics can be financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. Each PRSU award reflects a target number of shares (Target Shares) that may be issued to an award recipient before adjusting based on the Company’s financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. The actual number of shares that a grant recipient receives at the end of the period may range from\n0\n% to\n250\n% of the Target Shares granted, depending upon the degree of achievement of the performance target designated by each individual award.\n\n77\n\nTable of Contents\n\nESPP.\nUnder the 2017 Plan, eligible employees who participate in an offering period may have up to\n15\n% of their eligible earnings withheld, up to certain limitations, to purchase shares of common stock at\n85\n% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last business day of the\nsix-month\noffering period. The offering periods commence in May and November each year.\nAs of December 28, 2024, the Company had\n60\nmillion shares of common stock that were available for future grants and\n34\nmillion shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options or the vesting of unvested RSUs, including PRSUs, under the 2023 Plan and the Prior Plans.\nValuation and Expense\nStock-based compensation expense was allocated in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows:\nYear Ended\nDecember 28, 2024\nDecember 30, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\n(In millions)\nCost of sales\n$\n21\n$\n30\n$\n29\nResearch and development\n1,079\n1,002\n697\nMarketing, general, and administrative\n307\n352\n355\nTotal stock-based compensation expense before income taxes\n1,407\n1,384\n1,081\nIncome tax benefit\n(\n251\n)\n(\n249\n)\n(\n179\n)\nTotal stock-based compensation expense, net of income taxes\n$\n1,156\n$\n1,135\n$\n902\nStock Options.\nThe weighted-average estimated fair value of employee stock options granted during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n68.38\n, $\n53.72\nand $\n44.35\nper share, respectively, using the following assumptions:\nDecember 28, 2024\nDecember 30, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nExpected volatility\n54.34\n%\n52.36\n% -\n52.42\n%\n51.28\n%\nRisk-free interest rate\n3.80\n%\n3.93\n% -\n4.11\n%\n3.00\n%\nExpected dividends\n—\n%\n—\n%\n—\n%\nExpected life (in years)\n4.98\n4.96\n-\n5.04\n4.75\nThe Company uses a combination of the historical volatility of its common stock and the implied volatility for publicly traded options on the Company’s common stock as the expected volatility assumption.

The expected dividend yield is\nzero\nas the Company does not expect to pay dividends in the near future.

The expected term of the ESPP represents the six-month offering period.\nDuring 2024,\n2\nmillion shares of common stock were purchased under the ESPP at an average purchase price of $\n111\nresulting in aggregate cash proceeds of $\n265\nmillion. As of December 28, 2024, the Company had $\n43\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation expense related to the ESPP, which will be recognized over the weighted-average period of\n0.37\nyears.\n\nNOTE 13 –\nRetirement Benefit Plans\n\nThe Company provides retirement benefit plans in the United States and certain foreign countries. The Company has a 401(k) retirement plan that allows participating employees in the United States to contribute as defined by the plan and subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations. The Company matches\n75\n% of employees’ contributions up to\n6\n% of their eligible compensation. The Company’s contributions to the 401(k) plan for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were approximately $\n78\nmillion, $\n70\nmillion and $\n47\nmillion, respectively.\n\nNOTE 14 –\nRestructuring Charges\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company implemented a restructuring plan (the 2024 Restructuring Plan) focused on driving efficiencies and aligning resources with the Company’s largest growth opportunities in the AI and enterprise markets. The 2024 Restructuring Plan will primarily reduce global workforce by approximately 4% of headcount. Restructuring charges are included within the All Other category presented in Note 4 – Segment Reporting. Significant asset impairment charges are discussed in Note 6 - Acquisition-related Intangible Assets and Goodwill. The Company expects actions associated with the 2024 Restructuring Plan to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. As of December 28, 2024, $\n89\nmillion of accrued restructuring charges are recorded within Accrued liabilities of the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table summarizes activities and components of liabilities related to the 2024 Restructuring Plan:\nEmployee severance and benefits\nAsset impairment\nTotal\n(in millions)\nLiability as of December 30, 2023\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n—\nCurrent period costs\n113\n73\n186\nCash payments\n(\n24\n)\n—\n(\n24\n)\nNon-cash charges\n—\n(\n73\n)\n(\n73\n)\nLiability as of December 28, 2024\n$\n89\n$\n—\n$\n89\n\n80\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNOTE 15 –\nIncome Taxes\n\nIncome before income taxes consists of the following:\nYear Ended\nDecember 28, 2024\nDecember 30, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\n(In millions)\nU.S.\n$\n2,369\n$\n454\n$\n2,093\nNon-U.S.\n(\n347\n)\n54\n(\n895\n)\nTotal pre-tax income including equity income in investee\n$\n2,022\n$\n508\n$\n1,198\nThe income tax provision (benefit) consists of:\nYear Ended\nDecember 28, 2024\nDecember 30, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\n(In millions)\nCurrent:\nU.S. federal\n$\n1,338\n$\n496\n$\n1,191\nU.S. state and local\n64\n27\n31\nNon-U.S.\n142\n150\n161\nTotal\n1,544\n673\n1,383\nDeferred:\nU.S. federal\n(\n311\n)\n(\n860\n)\n(\n1,365\n)\nU.S. state and local\n6\n(\n29\n)\n(\n26\n)\nNon-U.S.\n(\n858\n)\n(\n130\n)\n(\n114\n)\nTotal\n(\n1,163\n)\n(\n1,019\n)\n(\n1,505\n)\nIncome tax provision (benefit)\n$\n381\n$\n(\n346\n)\n$\n(\n122\n)\nThe table below displays the reconciliation between statutory federal income taxes and the total income tax provision (benefit).\nYear Ended\nDecember 28, 2024\nDecember 30, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\n(In millions)\nStatutory federal income tax expense at 21%\n$\n425\n$\n107\n$\n252\nTax effect from intercompany integration transaction\n373\n—\n—\nForeign rate detriment (benefit)\n153\n(\n11\n)\n195\nInterest and penalty\n136\n53\n33\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit\n22\n(\n2\n)\n(\n3\n)\nForeign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII) deduction\n(\n275\n)\n(\n185\n)\n(\n261\n)\nResearch credits\n(\n232\n)\n(\n169\n)\n(\n241\n)\nGILTI and other foreign inclusion\n(\n133\n)\n(\n138\n)\n(\n96\n)\nStock-based and non-deductible compensation\n(\n101\n)\n(\n17\n)\n(\n6\n)\nOther\n13\n16\n5\nIncome tax provision (benefit)\n$\n381\n$\n(\n346\n)\n$\n(\n122\n)\nThe Company recorded an income tax provision of $\n381\nmillion and an income tax benefit of $\n346\nmillion in 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing effective tax rates of\n19\n% and (\n68\n)%, respectively. The increase in income tax provision in 2024 was primarily due to higher pre-tax income and a $373 million tax effect from an intercompany integration transaction.\n\n81\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBeginning in 2022, provisions in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 require the Company to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures rather than deducting the costs as incurred. The capitalization resulted in an increase in 2024 and 2023 taxable income which also increased the income eligible for the FDII tax benefit.\nAs a part of the Xilinx acquisition and as a result of certain employment and operational commitments the Company has made in Singapore, the Company has been granted a Development and Expansion Incentive (DEI) that is effective through 2031. The DEI reduces the local tax on Singapore income from a statutory rate of 17% to 5% through 2031. Due to the current year pre-tax loss in Singapore, the Company did not receive any income tax or earnings per share benefit.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of tax carryovers and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the balances for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were as follows:\nDecember 28,\n2024\nDecember 30,\n2023\n(In millions)\nDeferred tax assets:\nCapitalized R&D\n$\n2,892\n$\n1,753\nNet operating loss carryovers\n962\n992\nAccruals and reserves not currently deductible\n829\n574\nFederal and state tax credit carryovers\n679\n660\nForeign R&D and investment tax credits\n579\n597\nEmployee benefits not currently deductible\n334\n302\nLease liability\n182\n181\nForeign tax credits\n77\n71\nOther\n111\n96\nTotal deferred tax assets\n6,645\n5,226\nLess: valuation allowance\n(\n2,136\n)\n(\n2,124\n)\nTotal deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n4,509\n3,102\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nAcquired intangibles\n(\n3,614\n)\n(\n3,104\n)\nGILTI\n(\n222\n)\n(\n524\n)\nRight-of-use assets\n(\n182\n)\n(\n175\n)\nOther\n(\n152\n)\n(\n135\n)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n(\n4,170\n)\n(\n3,938\n)\nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities)\n$\n339\n$\n(\n836\n)\nDuring 2024, the Company executed an intercompany integration transaction and remeasured associated deferred taxes, resulting in increases to the deferred tax liability for acquisition-related intangibles and the deferred tax asset for Capitalized R&D, partially offset by a decrease in the deferred tax liability for GILTI.\nThe movement in the deferred tax valuation allowance was as follows:\nDecember 28, 2024\nDecember 30, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\n(In millions)\nBalance at beginning of year\n$\n2,124\n$\n2,078\n$\n1,735\nCharges to income tax expense and other accounts\n9\n41\n112\nAcquisition-related\n3\n5\n231\nBalance at end of year\n$\n2,136\n$\n2,124\n$\n2,078\n\n82\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThrough the end of fiscal year 2024, the Company continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.\nThe Company’s U.S. federal and state net operating losses (NOLs) carryforwards as of December 28, 2024, were $\n134\nmillion and $\n362\nmillion, respectively. NOLs may be subject to limitations by the Internal Revenue Code and similar provisions. $27 million of U.S. federal NOLs will expire between 2025 and 2037, and $107 million of federal NOLs have no expiration date. State NOLs will expire at various dates through 2043. The difference between the amount of federal NOLs which are recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as deferred tax assets and their related valuation allowance, and the amounts reported on the Company’s tax returns are the result of uncertain tax positions the Company has taken for which an income tax reserve has been recorded. The federal tax credits of $\n12\nmillion will expire at various dates between 2037 and 2042. The state tax return credits of $\n804\nmillion will expire at various dates between 2025 and 2039, except for the California R&D credit, which does not expire. The Company also has $\n620\nmillion of credit carryforward in Canada that will expire between 2028 and 2044.\nA\nreconciliation of the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:\nDecember 28, 2024\nDecember 30, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\n(In millions)\nBalance at beginning of year\n$\n1,463\n$\n1,361\n$\n275\nIncreases for tax positions taken in the current year\n57\n53\n748\nIncreases for tax positions taken in prior years\n24\n57\n104\nDecreases for tax positions taken in prior years\n(\n18\n)\n(\n8\n)\n(\n12\n)\nIncreases to tax positions taken in prior years through acquisitions\n—\n—\n252\nDecreases for settlements with taxing authorities and statute of limitation lapses\n(\n28\n)\n—\n(\n6\n)\nBalance at end of year\n$\n1,498\n$\n1,463\n$\n1,361\nThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate if recognized was $\n1.3\nbillion, $\n1.3\nbillion and $\n1.2\nbillion as of December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The Company had $\n298\nmillion, $\n142\nmillion and $\n81\nmillion of accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. As of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the Company had long-term income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of $\n1.4\nbillion, recorded under Other long-term liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Earnings from non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax. The material jurisdiction in which the Company is subject to potential examination by the taxing authority is the United States, where tax years from 2008 are open for audit. Pre-acquisition Xilinx U.S. tax returns for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 are currently under audit by the IRS. It is possible the Company may have tax audits close in the next 12 months that could materially change the balance of the uncertain tax benefits; however, the timing of tax audit closures and settlements are highly uncertain.\nUnder current U.S. tax law, the impact of future distributions of undistributed earnings that are indefinitely reinvested are anticipated to be subject to withholding taxes from local jurisdictions and non-conforming U.S. state jurisdictions. There were no cumulative undistributed earnings that are indefinitely reinvested that could be subject to withholding taxes as of December 28, 2024.\n\n83\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNOTE 16 –\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n\nThe following table summarizes the components of Other income (expense), net:\nYear Ended\nDecember 28, 2024\nDecember 30, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\n(In millions)\nInterest income\n$\n182\n$\n206\n$\n65\nGains (losses) on equity investments, net\n2\n(\n1\n)\n(\n62\n)\nOther income (expense)\n(\n3\n)\n(\n8\n)\n5\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n181\n$\n197\n$\n8\n\nNOTE 17 –\nCommitments and Guarantees\n\nOperating Leases\nThe Company has entered into operating and finance leases for its corporate offices, data centers, research and development facilities and certain equipment.

For 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recorded $\n83\nmillion, $\n46\nmillion, and $\n40\nmillion respectively, of variable lease expense, which primarily included operating expenses and property taxes associated with the usage of facilities under the operating leases. For 2024, 2023, and 2022 cash paid for operating leases included in operating cash flows was $\n155\nmillion $\n147\nmillion and $\n108\nmillion, respectively.

Purchase commitments include obligations made under noncancellable purchase orders and contractual obligations requiring minimum purchases or for which cancellation would lead to significant penalties.\nTotal future unconditional purchase commitments as of December 28, 2024 were as follows:\nYear\n(In millions)\n2025\n$\n4,501\n2026\n274\n2027\n46\n2028\n46\n2029\n45\n2030 and thereafter\n56\nTotal unconditional purchase commitments\n$\n4,968\nOn an ongoing basis, the Company works with suppliers on the timing of payments and deliveries of purchase commitments, taking into account business conditions.\nWarranties and Indemnities\nThe Company generally warrants that its products sold to its customers will conform to its approved specifications and be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and conditions for one year. The Company may also offer, in general, one to three-year limited warranties based on product type and negotiated warranty terms with certain customers. The Company accrues warranty costs to Cost of sales at the time of sale of warranted products.\nChanges in the Company’s estimated liability for product warranty during 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\nDecember 28,\n2024\nDecember 30,\n2023\n(In millions)\nBeginning balance\n$\n85\n$\n65\nProvisions during the period\n213\n126\nSettlements during the period\n(\n110\n)\n(\n106\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n188\n$\n85\nIn addition to product warranties, the Company from time to time in its normal course of business indemnifies other parties with whom it enters into contractual relationships, including customers, lessors and parties to other transactions with the Company, with respect to certain matters. In these limited matters, the Company has agreed to hold certain third parties harmless against specific types of claims or losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, third-party claims that the Company’s products when used for their intended purpose(s) and under specific conditions infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party, or other specified claims made against the indemnified party. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under these indemnification obligations due to the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in each particular claim and indemnification provision. Historically, payments made by the Company under these obligations have not been material. In addition, the impact from changes in estimates for pre-existing warranties has been immaterial.\n\nNOTE 18 –\nContingencies\n\nLitigation and Other Legal Matters\nAs of December 28, 2024, there were no material legal proceedings.\n\n85\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various actions that arose in the normal course of business. With respect to these matters, based on management’s current knowledge, the Company believes that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss, if any, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\n86\n\nTable of Contents\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the Company) as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 5, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n87\n\nTable of Contents\n\nInventory Valuation\nDescription of the Matter\nAt December 28, 2024, the Company’s net inventory balance was $5,734 million. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adjusts the inventory carrying value to the lower of actual cost or the estimated net realizable value after completing ongoing reviews of on-hand inventory quantities exceeding forecasted demand, and by considering recent historical activity as well as anticipated demand.\nAuditing management’s inventory excess and obsolescence reserves involved significant judgment because the estimates are based on several factors that are affected by market, industry, and competitive conditions outside the Company's control. In estimating excess and obsolescence reserves, management developed certain assumptions, including forecasted demand which are sensitive to the competitiveness of product offerings, customer requirements, and product life cycles. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company's inventory excess and obsolescence reserves estimation process, including the basis for developing the above-described assumptions and management’s judgments.\nOur audit procedures included, among others, testing the reasonableness of management’s key assumptions and judgments and testing the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used to determine the amount of excess and obsolescence reserves. We compared the quantities and carrying value of on-hand inventories to related unit sales, both historical and forecasted, and evaluated the appropriateness and adequacy of management’s adjustments to such sales forecasts by analyzing potential technological changes in line with product life cycles. We also assessed the accuracy of forecasts underlying management's estimates by comparing management’s historical forecasts to actual results, evaluated industry and market factors and performed sensitivity analyses over the forecasted demand used by management to determine inventory excess and obsolescence reserves.\n\n/s/\nErnst & Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1970.\n\nSan Jose, California\n\nFebruary 5, 2025\n\n88\n\nTable of Contents\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 5, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n89\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\nSan Jose, California\n\nFebruary 5, 2025\n\n90\n\nTable of Contents",

This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that conclusions of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. The overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them, as necessary. We intend to maintain the disclosure controls as dynamic systems that we adjust as circumstances merit. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report.\n\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nInternal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n1.\nPertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\n\n2.\nProvide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\n\n3.\nProvide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations.\n\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company.\n\n91\n\nTable of Contents\n\nManagement has used the 2013 framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 28, 2024 at the reasonable assurance level. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024, which is included in Part II, Item 8, above.\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThere has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.",
